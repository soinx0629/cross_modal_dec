0	14260	So, I'm not depressed now, but I was depressed for a long time and I wrote about being depressed
14260	23460	and I lived for a long time with blinding depression and had long stretches when everything
23460	29520	seemed hopeless and pointless, when returning calls from friends seemed like more than I
29520	36200	could do, when getting up and going out into the world seemed painful, when I was completely
36200	42720	crippled with anxiety and when I finally got better and started writing about the process
42720	47760	of recovery, I became very interested in all of the different kinds of treatment that there
47760	53060	were for depression and having started as a kind of medical conservative thinking that
53060	57240	there were only a couple of things that worked, medication and certain talking therapies
57240	62160	and that that was really it, I very gradually began to change my mind because I realized
62160	67480	that if you have brain cancer and you decide that standing on your head and gargling for
67480	71960	half an hour every day makes you feel better, it may make you feel better, but the likelihood
71960	76360	is that you still have brain cancer and you're still going to die from it.
76360	80200	But if you have depression and you say that standing on your head and gargling for half
80200	87320	an hour makes you feel better, then you are actually cured because depression is an illness
87320	91960	of how you feel and if you feel really great after you do that, then you're not depressed
91960	92960	anymore.
92960	98200	So I began to think all kinds of things could work and I researched everything ranging from
98200	105640	experimental brain surgeries to hypnotic regimens of various kinds, I had people writing to
105640	109840	me because I had been publishing on this subject, there was one woman who wrote to me and she
109840	115160	said that she had tried actually electroshock treatments and a variety of other approaches
115160	120720	to depression, medication and therapy and she had finally found the thing that worked
120720	125520	for her and she wanted me to tell the world about it and that was making little things
125520	137000	from yarn, some of which she sent me and none of which I'm wearing right now, but in any
137080	143680	event I had that rich engagement and I also became interested as I was doing this work
143680	149360	in the idea that depression existed not only in the civilized west as people tended to
149360	157200	perceive it to exist but actually across cultures and had existed across time and so when one
157200	162240	of my dearest friends, my friend David Hecht who was living for a little while in Senegal
162440	167880	said to me, do you know about the tribal rituals that are used for the treatment of depression
167880	168880	here?
168880	173480	I said no, I don't know about them but I would like to know about them and he said well if
173480	178560	you come for a visit we could try to do some research on this topic and so I set off for
178560	187680	Senegal and I met David and I was introduced to David's then girlfriend, now ex-wife Ellen
188240	195240	and it turned out that Ellen had a cousin whose mother was a friend of someone who went
195240	201040	to school with the daughter of a person who actually practiced the ndop and that I could
201040	206880	therefore go and interview this woman who had practiced the ndop and so we went off
206880	215160	to a small town about two hours outside of Dakar and I was introduced to this extraordinary
215520	223920	old large woman wrapped in miles and miles of African fabric printed with figures of
223920	229120	eyes and she was Madame D'Youff and we did an interview for about an hour and she told
229120	235040	me all about the ndop and at the end of it feeling rather daring I said, listen I said
235040	239920	I hope, I don't know whether this is something you would even consider I said but would it
239920	247480	be possible for me to attend an ndop and she said well I've certainly never had a foreigner the
247480	253640	local word was to Bob I've never had a foreigner attend one of these before she said but actually
253640	258640	she said I mean you've come through these friends and these connections she said yes the next time
258640	264280	I perform an ndop you may be present and I said that's fantastic I said when are you next going
264280	271920	to be doing an ndop and she said oh it'll be sometime in the next six months and I said six
271920	278480	months is quite a long time for me to stay here in this town waiting for you to do one I said is
278480	285480	there anyone who might maybe we could expedite one for somebody move it forward I'll pitch in
285480	293080	she said no it really doesn't work that way she said I'm sorry but that's that's how it is and
293560	298360	I said well I guess I won't be able to see an ndop then but even so this conversation has been
298360	306040	so interesting and so helpful to me and and I I'm a little sad leaving here about not actually
306040	311120	getting to see one but but I thank you and she's well I'm glad that you could come I'm glad it was
311120	317240	helpful and she said but there is one other thing she said I I hope you don't mind my saying this
317240	325480	and I said no what what is it and she said you don't look that great yourself she said are you
325480	332240	you are suffering from depression and I said well yes I said I was very acute it's kind of a little
332240	337960	better now but yeah I still do actually suffer from depression she said well I've certainly
337960	347680	never done this for a tuba before but I could actually do an ndop for you and I said oh I said
347680	355960	what an what an interesting idea I said well um yes sure yeah absolutely yes let's let's let's do
355960	362080	that I said that I'll have an ndop and she said oh well that's great she said and she gave us some
362960	370360	sort of fairly basic instructions and then we left and my translator the aforementioned then
370360	376600	girlfriend now ex-wife of my friend turned to me and she said are you completely crazy do you have
376600	382480	any idea what you're getting yourself into and I said well you know I'm all these things very
382480	387480	interesting she said you're crazy she said you're totally crazy but I'll help you if you want so we
387480	392120	had left and the first thing we had was a shopping list there had been a she had you could get them
392120	396720	to buy the stuff but you had to pay a surcharge I'd said no we'd buy the stuff so we had to go
396720	406240	out we had to buy seven yards of African fabric we had to get a calabash which was a large bowl
406240	413880	fashioned from a gourd we had to get three kilos of millet we had to get sugar we had to get cola
414040	422920	beans and then we had to get two live cockerels two roosters and a ram and so Ellen and I went
422920	427640	to the market with David and with these other people and we got most of the things and I said
427640	434000	well but what what about the the ram and Ellen said we can't buy the ram today what are we gonna
434000	443840	do with it overnight so I saw the sense of that so the next day the next day we got into a taxi
443840	450000	to go back out two hours to where we were going and I said what about the ram and Ellen said oh
450000	456120	we'll see a ram along the way so we were going along and going along and there was a Senegalese
456120	461880	shepherd by the side of the road with his flock and we stopped the cab and we got out and we
461880	468960	bought the ram for seven dollars and then we had a little bit of a struggle getting the live ram
468960	477280	into the trunk of the taxi cab so but the cab driver seemed not at all worried even by the fact
477280	484280	that the ram kept relieving himself in the trunk of the taxi cab and so then we got to Rufi's can
484280	491200	we got there so here I am I'm ready for my close-up and the thing about the end up is that it varies
491200	497200	enormously depending on a whole variety of signals and symbols that come from above so we have to go
497200	502960	through this whole shamanistic process and I still didn't know really very much of what was gonna
502960	509200	happen so first I had to change out of my jeans my t-shirt and put on a loincloth and then I sat
509200	517520	down and then I had my chest and my arms rubbed with millet and then which is a grain and then
517520	522640	someone said oh we really should have music for this and I said oh great and I thought you know
522640	527720	drumming I thought some atmospheric thing and she came out with her very prized possession which
527720	535880	was a battery-operated tape player for which she had one tape which was chariots of fire so we
535880	542920	started listening to chariots of fire and in the meanwhile I was given sort of various shamanistic
542920	547320	objects I had to hold them with my hands and drop them I had to hold them with my feet and drop them
547320	551920	I they would sort of say oh this augurs well this augurs badly there were five assistants to Madame
551920	555960	Diouf who had all gathered around and we sort of spent the morning like this and it was all really
555960	563680	just fine and then they said it was maybe we'd started at about 8 maybe about 11 11 30 they said
563680	569880	well now it's actually time for the the central part of the ritual and I said oh okay and the
569880	574200	sound of drumming began the drumming I'd been hoping for the drumming began and so there was
574200	580720	all of this drumming and it was very exciting and we went to the central square of the village
580760	590040	where there was a small makeshift wedding bed that I had to get into with the ram and I had been told
590040	595360	it would be very very bad luck if the ram escaped and that I had to hold on to him and that the
595360	600400	reason we had to be in this wedding bed was that all my depression and all my problems were caused
600400	605400	by the fact that I had spirits in Senegal you have spirits that have all over you the way here you
605400	610200	sort of have microbes some are good for you some are bad for you some are neutral anyway my bad
610200	616840	spirits were extremely jealous of my real-life sexual partners some of whom are here tonight and
616840	626480	and that we had to mollify the anger of the of the spirit so I had to get into this wedding
626480	631600	bed with the ram and I had to hold the ram very tightly because he he was not having a good life
631600	638800	this ram and he of course immediately relieved himself on my leg and the entire village had
638800	644720	taken the day off from their work in the fields and were dancing around us in concentric circles
644720	650160	and as they danced throwing blankets and sheets of cloth over us and so we were gradually being
650160	654760	buried and it was unbelievably hot and it was completely stifling and there was the sound of
654760	658960	these stamping feet as everyone danced around us and then these drums which were getting louder
658960	663440	and louder and more ecstatic and more ecstatic and I was just about at the point at which I
663440	671080	thought I was going to faint or pass out at that key moment suddenly all of the claws were pulled
671080	676640	off I was yanked to my feet the loincloth that was all I was wearing was pulled from me the poor
676640	682520	old Rams throat was slit as were the throats of the two cockerels and I was covered in the blood
682520	689680	of the freshly slaughtered ram and the cockerels and so there I was naked totally covered in blood
689720	702320	and they said okay that's the end of this part of it and I said well okay and they said but you they
702320	706480	said we're actually we but there's the next piece comes now and I said okay and we went over back
706480	711040	to the area where we've done the morning preparations and one of them said but look it's it's kind of
711040	716440	lunchtime why don't we just take a break for a minute would you like a coke I don't drink
716440	720760	coke that much but at that moment it seemed like a really really really good idea and I said yes
720760	726560	and so I sat there naked and completely covered in animal blood with flies kind of gathering as
726560	731480	they will when you're naked and covered in animal blood and I drank this coke and then when I had
731480	738360	finished the coke they said okay now we have the sort of final parts of the ritual they said so
738360	743160	first you have to put your your hands by your sides and and hold your stand very straight and
743880	750400	I said okay and then they tied me up with the intestines of the ram and in the meanwhile it
750400	754840	was hanging from a nearby tree and they were there were some instead of doing some butchering of it
754840	760920	and they took various little bits of it out and then I had to kind of shuffle over all tied up in
760920	768640	in intestines which most of you probably haven't done but it's hard I had to shuffle over and I
768640	775320	had to take these little pieces of the ram and I had to dig holes and I had to put the pieces of
775320	781000	the ram in the holes and I had to say something and what I had to say was actually to me incredibly
781000	788720	strangely touching in the middle of this weird experience I had to say spirits leave me alone
788720	796520	to complete the business of my life and know that I will never forget you and I thought what a kind
796520	802800	thing to say to the evil spirits you're exercising that I'll never forget you and I haven't so anyway
802800	808160	there were various other little bits and pieces that followed I was given a piece of paper in
808160	813440	which all of the millet from the morning had been gathered I was told that the next morning I should
813440	817560	sleep with it under my pillow and in the morning get up and give it to a beggar who had good
817560	822760	hearing and no deformities and that when I gave it to him that would be the end of my troubles and
822760	829560	then the women sort of all filled their mouths with water and began spitting water all over me
829560	835120	which it turns out is the sort of you know it's the surround shower effect and rinsing the blood
835120	841160	away from me and it gradually came off and when I was clean they gave me back my jeans and everyone
841160	852400	danced and they barbecued the ram and we had this dinner and I felt so up I felt so up it had it had
852400	857560	been quite an astonishing experience even though I didn't believe in the animus principles behind
857560	864440	it all of these people had been gathered together cheering for me and it was very exhilarating and
864440	870560	I had a very odd experience five years later when I was working on my current book and I was in
870560	875560	Rwanda doing something else altogether and I got into a conversation with someone there and I
875560	880320	described the experience I'd had in Senegal and he said oh you know we have something that's a
880320	885120	little like that he said that's West Africa this is East Africa it's quite different but there are
885120	889600	some similarities in some rituals here he said you know we had a lot of trouble with Western
889600	894680	mental health workers who came here immediately after the genocide and we had to ask some of them
894680	901920	to leave and I said what what was the problem and he said okay they came and their practice did not
901920	906480	involve being outside in the Sun like what you're describing which is after all where you begin to
906480	911480	feel better there was no music or drumming to get your blood flowing again when you're depressed
911480	916800	and you're low and you need to have your blood flowing he said there was no sense that everyone
916800	921960	had taken the day off so that the entire community could come together to try to lift you up and
921960	926520	bring you back to joy he said there was no acknowledgement the depression as something
926520	932480	invasive and external that could actually be cast out of you again he said instead they would take
932480	938040	people one at a time into these dingy little rooms and have them sit around for an hour or
938040	948800	so and talk about bad things that had happened to them he said we had to get them to leave the
948800	950840	country thank you

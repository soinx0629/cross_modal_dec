1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
My story is about a number of jobs

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,600
that sort of shaped my life and shaped my whole destiny.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,680
And it was a couple of jobs I had

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,240
during the ages of 20 to 21.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,200
So the story begins in, yes, I was employed back then.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,800
Okay, I don't know why you laughed, but I'll accept that.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,640
It's a good sign.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,900
Okay, I'm thinking out loud here.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,660
All right, so in 1984, I was a sophomore at Princeton.

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,000
You can laugh at that if you like.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
All right, so in 1984, I was a sophomore at Princeton.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,800
I wanted to take a year off

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,120
because I had a very bad reputation at school.

14
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,400
I was drinking a lot, getting in a lot of trouble,

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,760
so I wanted to take a year off.

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,360
Also, I had joined the Army to pay for Princeton,

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,240
and I was looking at four years of active duty after school

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,960
and eight years of reserve duty.

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,120
So this was my last chance at freedom,

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,880
was after, you know, taking this year off from school.

21
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,600
Later, just for the Harpers crowd,

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
I did become a conscientious objector,

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,320
and so I got out of the military.

24
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,160
And so, and avoided the Gulf War

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,840
unlike my fellow ROTC guys, which is a good thing.

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,560
All right, so, but this was before I knew

27
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,540
I was getting out of the Army.

28
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,760
This was gonna be my year of freedom.

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,720
I needed to make money, though, during this year off,

30
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,120
and a friend of mine, I know it's going to seem absurd,

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,900
suggested that I be a model,

32
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,280
and he took some pictures of me.

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,840
I know I have rings under my eyes

34
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,800
that go all the way to the back of my skull,

35
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,660
and I have no hair, but at 20,

36
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,780
he had it in his mind that I should be a model.

37
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,280
So he takes some pictures of me,

38
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,020
and I thought I was ugly, but I was vain enough to try it.

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,520
I don't know what I was thinking.

40
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,500
So I go, I look up in the Princeton Library,

41
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,820
they had a Manhattan phone book, and I look up modeling,

42
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,460
and I choose a modeling agency,

43
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,340
and I go into New York with these pictures.

44
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,580
This fellow takes them, he says,

45
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,700
can I hold these overnight?

46
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,500
I said yes, and the next morning he calls me,

47
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,940
come into New York, we want to sign you to a contract.

48
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,140
He had sent my pictures to the photographer Bruce Weber,

49
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,700
who does the Abercrombie and Fritch and Vanity Fair,

50
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,520
however you say Abercrombie, whatever,

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,460
and that this fellow wanted to photograph me.

52
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,020
So suddenly, with this small agency,

53
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,380
which existed for about a year,

54
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,300
and then there was a scandal

55
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,380
with young female models from Minnesota,

56
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,260
so suddenly I'm a model,

57
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,980
and I'm going off to this Bruce Weber photo shoot,

58
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,520
and I remember we met early in the morning,

59
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,940
a bunch of us, a bunch of male models in a van,

60
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,100
and as we're going off to the Hamptons for this photo shoot,

61
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,700
it was like six a.m., this one guy looks around,

62
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,020
he's from Texas, he goes, hey, we're all blonde.

63
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,420
You know, it just had dawned on him,

64
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,680
sort of, it was kind of interesting.

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,220
And so we get out to the Hamptons,

66
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,420
and we're at this farmhouse,

67
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,420
and it was like a scene out of Christopher Isherwood's

68
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,220
The Berlin Stories, all these blonde boys,

69
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,420
about 10 of us, running around doing pushups

70
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,980
so that our muscles would swell,

71
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,100
and in and out of the pool, and a big buffet,

72
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,640
and everything, waiting for the light to change.

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,260
And so I get my picture taken by Bruce Weber,

74
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,480
wonderful guy, very talented, obviously,

75
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,000
and he wanted me to drop my shorts,

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,380
and I felt embarrassed, I didn't think I could do that,

77
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,360
and so I, anyways, I hid everything,

78
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,260
I wasn't able to expose myself.

79
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,980
So anyways, he took these pictures of me,

80
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,120
and I have one, and I'm going to pass it out

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,520
as a sort of gift for you.

82
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,900
I only have 150 of them, so if you're one per table.

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,100
But this is the Bruce Weber picture of me.

84
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,680
And I was, anyway, the physique was looking good then,

85
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
and you can see I had hair,

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
it's sort of depressing to look at that now,

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,760
I don't know what happened, but anyway,

88
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,800
so I ended up in the Whitney Biennial,

89
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,340
I like to say to my artist friends,

90
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,840
I've been in the biennial, but it was in this picture.

91
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,720
And on the back of this is the thing from my nursery school,

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,400
just so you can study that if you like,

93
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,180
so pass those around.

94
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,560
So maybe one per table, since it's only 150,

95
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,080
but so it could get to the back.

96
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,040
All right, so here I am a model,

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,400
I got several jobs, but at that photo shoot

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,960
at Bruce Weber's farmhouse, I met a very pretty girl,

99
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,580
she was his assistant, and she gave me her phone number.

100
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,840
So about a week later, I'm doing my modeling appointments,

101
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,480
which are called go-sees,

102
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,400
which was made very simple for the models,

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,200
it was go-see someone,

104
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,340
and so this is what they called appointments, were go-sees.

105
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,220
So I'm on a day of go-sees,

106
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,640
and I found myself in the West Village,

107
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,600
and right by Cornelia Street,

108
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,440
and I remember that that girl lived on Cornelia Street,

109
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,160
and my high school love was a girl named Cornelia,

110
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,440
and so suddenly it was all fusing in my mind,

111
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,120
so I call her, and I get her roommate,

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,140
and I explain that I'm in the neighborhood,

113
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,500
I won't say her name, well, I'll say her name,

114
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,820
because I can't think of a new one,

115
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,620
I said, is Erin home, no, and I'm her roommate,

116
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,960
and I said, oh, I'm right in the neighborhood,

117
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,860
she said, well, if you wanna come up and wait for her,

118
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,540
it was late in the afternoon, she should be home soon.

119
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,340
I go, okay, so I go up to her apartment,

120
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,780
and I meet the roommate, who was about 30 years old,

121
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,540
and very beautiful, and very exotic to me,

122
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,540
I was 20, she was 30, and she offers me a glass of wine,

123
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,820
we end up drinking two bottles of wine,

124
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,620
not only has my life been shaped by jobs,

125
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,620
but also by liquor and sex,

126
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,380
which should appeal to the Glenn Fittich people,

127
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,980
so we drink some wine, we drink like two bottles of wine,

128
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,660
the first girl never comes home,

129
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,820
and I end up making love to the roommate,

130
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,660
which these things happened back then,

131
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,480
and so we're making love, and she was older,

132
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,140
and this was all very intriguing to me,

133
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,580
and at a penultimate moment,

134
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,540
the moment before, an ultimate moment,

135
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,500
I said to her, I said, can I have an ultimate moment,

136
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,220
because I wasn't using a condom,

137
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,460
this was sort of before the whole condom hysteria

138
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,700
and AIDS hysteria, and so everything was more

139
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,940
about birth control, I thought of a bad line earlier,

140
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,680
death control, so this was all about birth control,

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,020
and so I said, can I have an ultimate moment,

142
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,640
and she said, of course you can,

143
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,780
in a very sort of condescending way,

144
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,500
which was a bad thing to hear right at a penultimate moment,

145
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,260
because I don't know, it destroyed my confidence

146
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,160
as a young lover, oh, of course you can,

147
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,300
why didn't I know that, and so it wrecked my ultimate moment

148
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,060
a little, some short circuit had happened,

149
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,340
but it happened, and so I thought I learned

150
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,860
a valuable lesson, which is you never ask a woman

151
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,240
if you can have your ultimate moment,

152
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,940
you just go ahead and have it, you don't ask her

153
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,700
unless she tells you beforehand that, you know,

154
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,860
you need to be careful or something,

155
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,740
so I thought this was the valuable lesson

156
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,260
I learned to be a Lothario, never ask,

157
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,540
so I go off to Europe to be a model,

158
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,700
because I've done very well, I ended up being photographed

159
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,440
by this guy named Horst, and I was in bus stop ads

160
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,660
all over New York, and Fernando Sanchez lingerie

161
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,620
and a pair of bikinis or something,

162
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,220
so I go off to Europe to Milan to be a model,

163
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,060
but I travel for about a month and a half,

164
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,780
and I get in a terrible bar fight in Paris, France,

165
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,180
and I get my nose broken, and my lips split,

166
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,260
and my skull, knee, and everything got really beat up,

167
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,220
and I was supposed to report to Milan, Milano, whatever,

168
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,740
five days later, but my nose was all purple,

169
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,580
and I thought, you know what, I wanted to be a writer,

170
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,060
I thought a writer shouldn't be a model,

171
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,560
so I'm not gonna go to Milano,

172
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,220
and that's not a dignified job, so I became a male au pair

173
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,480
in Paris in the Montparnasse neighborhood,

174
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,080
but that was kind of a good job,

175
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,980
because I was right near where Hemingway would hang out

176
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,580
and even pass through the bakery that he used to pass through

177
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,780
to get to Gertrude Stein, and so I had my two little charges,

178
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,260
I think they were like six and three, and it was wonderful,

179
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,140
and I was the only au pair garçon in the whole quarter,

180
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,500
so I was with all these Swedish and German girls,

181
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,140
and it was even better than being a model

182
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,660
and going to Cornelia Street, so I did that

183
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,540
for five or so blissful months,

184
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,140
and then I come back to the States, and it's late spring,

185
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,900
and I go visit some friends at Princeton,

186
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,860
and yet again, I get completely drunk,

187
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,740
and then the next morning, I'm lying on the floor

188
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,820
of my friend's dorm room, and I'm totally drunk

189
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,140
and destroyed and debauched, and I'm lying on a hard floor,

190
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,940
and the school newspaper comes flying underneath the door,

191
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,060
there was like a bit of an inch,

192
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,020
comes flying under the door, and opens up to a page,

193
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,180
to the classifieds, as it sort of wafted across the room,

194
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,100
and it was right in front of me, and I look down,

195
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,620
and there was an advertisement saying,

196
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,000
come spend the summer in New Hampshire at Camp Thoreau,

197
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,480
on an idyllic lake, and I thought, this is what I need,

198
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,080
I need to stop drinking, I'm only 21,

199
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,480
but I'm already wanna stop drinking,

200
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,880
I'm sorry, Glen Fittish people,

201
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,240
and let me go off to New Hampshire to Camp Thoreau,

202
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,000
that's what I need to do, so I go off to Camp Thoreau,

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
and I got the job because I'd been in au pair,

204
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,160
so I knew how to deal with children,

205
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,120
I'd been a camp counselor during the summers

206
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,400
in New Jersey at a day camp, so I get the job,

207
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,440
I go off to Camp Thoreau, and I'm doing pretty well,

208
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,360
and then a friend of mine sends me Lolita,

209
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,840
which I had never read before,

210
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,720
which is not the best sort of reading material

211
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,720
when there's 12 and 13 year old girls running around,

212
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,600
it completely distracted me in the wrong way,

213
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
and so one night I got very drunk as always,

214
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
and ate some food, and the whole next day,

215
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,760
I was hungover the whole day,

216
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,520
had a terrible headache into the night,

217
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,440
and I was sort of walking around the camp,

218
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,880
trying to clear my head of this headache

219
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,280
that had lasted all day, and I see a light on

220
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,320
at the art counselor's cabin, and so I go to see her,

221
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,480
and she was 34, and I said, do you have an aspirin,

222
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,240
and she gets me an aspirin, and I had admired her

223
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,840
down by the lake, because I had noticed that

224
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,880
you could see some pubis sticking out from the sides,

225
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,400
and I thought this was a more appropriate target

226
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,640
for my affections than these young girls

227
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,280
and the Nabokov influence, so she gets me an aspirin,

228
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,880
and we're sort of chatting, and right in that moment,

229
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,880
a bat flies right between us, and we both scream,

230
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,800
out in the woods there in New Hampshire,

231
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
and I say, well maybe if we, and it's flying around,

232
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,360
I said, maybe if we turn the lights off,

233
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,720
I think bats are blind, but if we turn the lights off,

234
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,960
it'll see, I don't know what my reasoning was,

235
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,280
so I turn the lights off, and we wait,

236
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,040
I turn the lights back on, no bat, and I felt very much,

237
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,880
oh, I really am a woodsman, very much a Camp Thoreau fellow,

238
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,120
and right in that moment of hubris, as always,

239
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,220
the bat flies right between us, like some sort of mad cupid

240
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,600
goes right between us, and I turn the lights off again,

241
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,600
I put my arm around her, and one touch leads to another,

242
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,000
I think Blake has a poem about that, so anyway,

243
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,080
we end up in bed, and I remember the rule

244
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,760
that I had learned the year before with another older woman,

245
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,960
do not ask if you can have an ultimate moment,

246
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,480
just go ahead, and when you're ready,

247
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,320
have your ultimate moment, appropriately,

248
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,680
perhaps after she may have had one,

249
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,400
but I don't know if I knew that at 21.

250
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,200
So I had two ultimate moments that night,

251
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,000
it was quite lovely, but the next day,

252
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,760
it turned out I was terribly ill,

253
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,600
and I ended up having salmonella poisoning,

254
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,100
because I'd been drinking the night before in some bar

255
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,840
and ate something off the floor, who knows what,

256
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,240
but so I had salmonella poisoning,

257
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,120
and I ended up in Dartmouth Hospital,

258
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,360
and the camp year came to an end,

259
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,240
I never made love with the art counselor again,

260
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,820
but we parted amicably, it was very sweet,

261
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,800
and I go back to Princeton, become a conscientious objector,

262
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
I stole a novel after senior year,

263
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,040
I moved to New York to work on this novel,

264
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,640
and I get a letter from far away in the United States,

265
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,080
and I open it up, and it turns out,

266
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,840
it's a letter from the art counselor,

267
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,240
and with the letter is a picture of a 15-month-old baby boy

268
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,160
with red hair and blue eyes,

269
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,640
and I'm told that it's my son,

270
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,080
and nine months of pregnancy, 15 months of his life,

271
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,720
it was exactly two years ago,

272
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,800
and I was like, oh my God,

273
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,600
and it looked exactly like I did,

274
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,520
so sure enough, this moment that had begun

275
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,160
on Cornelia Street, and of course you can,

276
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,200
and then being an au pair and getting a camp job

277
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,920
and all this drinking had led to me looking at a child,

278
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,920
and I was 23 now, and so I went to where they lived,

279
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,640
and I became his dad, and it turned out,

280
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,480
all this au pair and counseling

281
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,040
had been wonderful training,

282
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,080
and I don't mean to be sentimental,

283
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,160
but that's why we have the word,

284
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,280
because sometimes it happens,

285
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,280
so I became his dad, and I have to say,

286
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,520
it's the best job I've ever had,

287
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,360
and my son is now 17, and he comes up in two days

288
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,520
to be with me for 10 days,

289
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,000
and I see him about every eight weeks,

290
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,240
and he's a beautiful boy,

291
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,360
and we've had an incredible father-son thing

292
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,880
for 15 years now,

293
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,520
so that's my story, and it all began with these jobs,

294
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,680
and somehow ended up there rather beautifully,

295
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,680
so I'll do a Harry call.

296
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
a Harry call.

297
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,680
Eeee.

298
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,320
A Harry call.

0	6520	So it starts in 1989 and it's July and I'm on tour with my band and we're
6520	10520	touring through Europe and this is a very usual thing I had been touring for
10520	16560	years and years seven or eight years by that point so it we had just come from
16560	21920	Israel and we had landed in the UK in England so I had never been to Israel
21920	25800	before and the first time you go there all the security is a bit daunting you
25800	29680	know they search you and they search you again and they ask you questions and I
29680	34760	found it a little scary so even though I really enjoyed my time there I was
34760	39680	looking forward to coming back to England which was very familiar to me so
39680	44680	this was we just landed in England we were staying at the Holiday Inn Airport
44680	53360	near Heathrow very glamorous so I wake up that morning and that night I'm going
53360	58620	to play at the Glastonbury Festival in Glastonbury so we have a journey to go
58660	63020	to and it's probably going to be the biggest audience I'm ever going to face
63020	69020	where there's supposed to be 75,000 or 80,000 people there and I'm headlining
69020	73540	that night it's a Friday night so I'm the last act on the show and all this is
73540	79860	okay this is fine I pack my stuff I go downstairs to the to the front desk and
79860	84340	there's some kind of altercation at the desk and I see my bass player Mikey and
84340	87500	he's looking really unhappy he's looking really pale and he's like I have Puerto
87580	92860	Rico and half Italian so pale is not his usual color so I am concerned about this
92860	97580	and then I also see my tour manager also looking really upset my manager there's
97580	102180	all this kind of buzzing going on I'm like what's going on so we all knew that
102180	106940	there had been some girl that had a crush on Mike you know and this happens
106940	109940	from time to time you know girls fall in love with the guys in the band and I
109940	115940	try and stay out of it you know and they send things or whatever and I try and lay
115940	119380	down rules you know we don't want random girls on the bus but you can have your
119380	125020	girlfriend or you can have your wife random girls off the bus but I kind of
125020	129100	knew about this random girl because she it started off with little gifts that
129100	132140	were coming backstage from Mike email thought that was really cute and then
132140	139820	after that graduated to pictures of herself naked and well whatever so but
139820	144860	then we all became worried because she had actually moved to Queens from London
144860	149500	to be near him when we were not on tour and we all felt that that was going too
149500	155620	far so now it turned out that now we're back in the UK and we are going to play
155620	160980	Glastonbury and she has called him in the middle of the night and made these
160980	166700	threats and said to him that she she and her friend who is a male guy who was
166700	171820	also calling the hotel we're going to shoot him if he went out on stage that
171820	182860	night so I'm like oh god I hate I hate that kind of day because I just want to
182860	186220	be in England where it's just nice you know and it was comfortable and it was
186220	190860	you know and Glastonbury is a festival of hippies basically they have a big
190860	195580	peace sign on the stage so and I'm thinking is this really gonna happen but
195580	200500	my manager feels that we should take it seriously so we call Scotland Yard so
200500	205940	we're all waiting for Mr. Scotland Yard to show up the detective shows up and he
205940	209580	takes the trip with us on the bus Mike is freaking out everybody's freaking out
209580	216060	so and I'm like okay so he asks us some questions he finds out some things about
216060	220500	this girl he finds out some things about the other man who was making the calls
220500	225620	and this kind of thing so the tension is kind of building it's a long trip and we
225620	228820	finally get there and we wind our way through this crowd of people and we're
228860	232340	trying to find our way backstage to where the bus is supposed to be and it's
232340	236060	kind of muddy I think it had rained and then it had stopped raining so now
236060	240340	there's all this dust and stuff in the air and as throngs of people and we're
240340	245900	trying to find our way backstage and once we get there I feel that I I need
245900	250580	to go for a walk I need a little privacy and I try and go for a walk I figure
250580	253900	I'll check out some of the booths that are selling tie-dyed things and military
253900	258700	surplus Mr. Scotland Yard wants to walk with me and I'm like no no it's okay
258860	262460	you know you stay with Mike I'll be fine no miss Vega I feel I really should come
262460	267060	with you no I don't want you to come with me you can stay with Mike I need to
267060	275500	go off and he said no so I said okay fine I'll stay here then we were gonna
275500	282860	go on stage at about 11 o'clock at about 930 suddenly four or five policemen show
282860	286260	up and they come onto the bus and they want to have a little chat with me and
286820	290740	I'm like why you know Mike will be fine he's gonna perform on the side of the
290740	295020	stage we have two bodyguards for Mike he's gonna perform in a bulletproof vest
295020	298860	he's got the two bodyguards are there one looks like mr. clean and one looks
298860	302700	like GI Joe and they're very handsome guys and they're gonna defend Mike's I'm
302700	307700	like great what's the problem so the policemen sit me down and they said well
307700	312020	we didn't want to tell you this because we were we didn't want to upset you but
312020	316220	your life was also threatened they also said miss Vega if you go out on stage
316220	320580	you will also get it so being that we have tracked down the woman but we
320580	326260	haven't tracked down her accomplice we feel that we need to inform you legally
326260	330180	that you should not do this show tonight we feel that you should not perform on
330180	337340	stage tonight so I'm like what are you kidding like this is Friday night I'm
337340	341060	headlining the Glastonbury festival there's like a hundred thousand people
341060	344500	what do you mean I'm not gonna do the show of course I'm gonna do the show you
344540	347380	know the show must go on what are you talking about no one's gonna like shoot
347380	354500	me on the Glastonbury stage under the peace sign so and then I'm thinking well
354500	360300	anyway you don't want to know what I was thinking so so I said no no I'm said I
360300	364580	really have to do the show I feel that I really must and my my keyboard player
364580	367580	who's also my boyfriend is looking at me with tears in his eyes and he's like no
367580	371700	no I don't think you should do it I'm like I'm sorry we have to do it how can
371700	376260	we possibly come back to England if we don't do this show you know any crazy
376260	381020	person can call up on the phone and say you know whatever they're gonna say and
381020	385740	then we they everybody would know that we cancelled so they said okay well
385740	390460	you'll have to wear the bulletproof vest as well so I said okay the only one they
390460	396140	had was his and this policeman was about 250 pounds and I'm like half that size
396140	401100	so they put it on me and it's enormous and he strapped me in and they gaffers
401100	405780	tape it closed so I'm like okay and I'm like can I still play the guitar I think
405780	410460	so and then I have a they put a huge denim jacket on over that so no one
410460	414740	sees the bulletproof vest so now I'm all decked out like a turtle like this and
414740	418700	my arms are kind of like this I'm like okay but you know I felt really strongly
418700	422220	that we should we should go on we should risk our lives you know this is rock and
422220	429660	roll this is what this is what we do so I remember that moment as I was walking
429660	434340	out on the stage and I see the microphone there and I'm in my denim
434340	439820	jacket and my gaffers tape and my bulletproof vest and things start to
439820	444700	feel like I'm going underwater and as I'm heading for the microphone the
444700	448020	thought suddenly occurs to me that they could shoot me in the head and I'm like
448020	451620	oh I wish I hadn't thought that right now but I not thinking about that anymore
451620	455400	I'm just heading for the microphone and then I pick up the guitar and I start
455400	460680	singing and the other thing that happened was that now this whole
460680	464840	situation has escalated to the point where there's 20 policemen in front of
464840	469840	the stage there's a hundred thousand people behind them there's people as far
469840	473460	as the eye can see from the stage all the way to the horizon this is like
473460	478720	several villages or something not only that but there's helicopters overhead
478720	483640	and they've decided to train the lights not on the stage which they usually do
483640	487880	but from time to time they swivel the lights onto the audience to search them
487880	493120	to see if they see anyone with a weapon so I'm singing every song feels like
493120	498440	it's taking 20 minutes long small blue thing just seems to go on forever and
498440	501920	I'm looking at every so often they swivel the lights onto the audience and
501920	506740	I'm like you know and I continue to play and every so often I turn around to look
506740	511280	at Mike of course he's not there you know Mike is over there with mr. clean
511280	517360	the GI Joe and there's the his amplifier on the floor so it's like
517360	523720	where's Mike oh there's his amp so blah blah I'm playing it's all going pretty
523720	531480	well I'm thinking wow this is great that we're alive and suddenly my keyboard
531480	536000	player approaches me and he says sing Luca and get off stage and I'm like why
536000	541000	and he goes I can't tell you right now but we have to get off stage by 1230
541480	546040	and I'm like okay and then I start thinking well why do they want me to get
546040	549320	off stage did they find some did they find the weapon did they find the girl
549320	552560	did they find her accomplice maybe I should just get off stage and not sing
552560	558280	Luca Luca was my big hit at that point and it was and I decided no we're gonna
558280	561120	stay we're gonna sing Luca we're gonna entertain everybody I've come to be
561120	565480	entertained we have to do this I sing Luca everybody's cheering I come off
565480	570920	stage it feels like it's going in slow motion and I said what happened did they
570920	575920	find the girl no did they find her accomplice no they find somebody with a
575920	581560	weapon no well why did we have to get off stage at 1230 and then the promoter
581560	584440	of the festival comes over to me and says with Miss Vega we didn't get a
584440	588640	chance to explain this to you before but the festival has a curfew because the
588640	593760	farmers in the next field have the cows and the cows get disturbed if you sing
593760	603560	past 1230 and it makes them less productive and that's my story

00:00.000 --> 00:12.120
So, about a month into my daughter's kindergarten career, beginning of her being in school,

00:12.120 --> 00:22.920
I was informed by her mother that her teacher was concerned about how she was doing in a

00:22.920 --> 00:26.520
month into kindergarten.

00:26.520 --> 00:36.160
You would think that there's not a whole lot that you need to know how to do, but apparently

00:36.160 --> 00:41.280
my daughter was giving her teacher calls for concern.

00:41.280 --> 00:50.880
And so, at the earliest opportunity, which was the parental observation day around Halloween,

00:50.920 --> 01:01.280
I went in to observe the class and it was all very familiar and it was clear to me what

01:01.280 --> 01:07.840
her teacher meant, even though it had been delivered to me in a really ambiguous and

01:07.840 --> 01:09.160
hard to understand way.

01:09.160 --> 01:17.520
I watched my daughter just be herself in this classroom, kind of blissfully unaware of what

01:17.680 --> 01:19.800
was expected of her.

01:19.800 --> 01:24.440
It seems all very innocent kindergarten and everything, but that's where they start training

01:24.440 --> 01:33.600
you how to be a part of society, which if you're into that kind of thing, that's awesome.

01:33.600 --> 01:45.200
But, you don't have much choice in this world, but so I'm watching her and watching her like

01:45.360 --> 01:51.560
do her thing and watching her teacher get frustrated with her to the point of near anger

01:51.560 --> 01:59.240
just because she's not jumping to the next thing that's being assigned to her because

01:59.240 --> 02:04.600
they have little sections in the day or in the afternoon they have to work on.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.240
It was very familiar.

02:07.240 --> 02:13.280
A nice thing that can happen with having children is that you can see yourself and you can be

02:13.360 --> 02:19.880
reminded of the progression of your own life through viewing them and I was brought back

02:19.880 --> 02:25.920
to my experience being in kindergarten and I can see myself very clearly in my daughter.

02:25.920 --> 02:35.520
We share a lot of similarities and I remember being handed rudimentary mathematics that

02:35.520 --> 02:40.200
you're supposed to start in kindergarten and not being interested at all.

02:40.200 --> 02:45.920
So not even bothering because it wasn't clear to me that it was like required.

02:45.920 --> 02:54.480
It was clear to me that she was kind of in the same place and her teacher, besides rubbing

02:54.480 --> 03:00.880
me the wrong way in a lot of ways, clearly didn't understand my daughter.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.520
I didn't want my daughter to stay in that school.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.400
I wanted her out.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.080
And that could be just...

03:08.080 --> 03:14.240
It's hard to say when you're dealing with your children because everyone thinks that

03:14.240 --> 03:25.640
their children are God's gift to the planet or sane people do, sane people do.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.000
So I wanted her out.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.520
I didn't think it was a good place for her but I didn't think anything was wrong with

03:32.520 --> 03:39.000
her but of course I didn't because I'm her father and it's very difficult to see your

03:39.000 --> 03:47.080
children clearly because I would like to say because of the incredible amount of love that

03:47.080 --> 03:51.440
you have for them but that's not totally honest because there's something besides the love,

03:51.440 --> 03:56.920
there's ego involved because there's such reflection of you, you want them to do good,

03:56.920 --> 04:01.920
you want them to be smart, you want them to be beautiful because you're smart and you're

04:01.920 --> 04:04.200
beautiful and you dig it.

04:04.200 --> 04:09.480
Or that's how you want to perceive yourself in this world and you want your children,

04:09.480 --> 04:12.680
your offspring to have that.

04:12.680 --> 04:19.080
That's maybe a little ugly but it's true and I think it's true for most parents.

04:19.080 --> 04:23.920
So I do love my daughter a great deal and I love myself.

04:23.920 --> 04:37.880
And I wanted her out of that school and her mother, a very fine woman, brilliant and beautiful,

04:37.880 --> 04:44.040
we're partnered in raising her, we're not partnered romantically, didn't want to hear

04:44.040 --> 04:50.040
me that maybe the teacher had the problem because she was beginning a career as a teacher

04:50.080 --> 04:57.320
and she always heard parents talk about how it was a teacher's problem and that they wouldn't

04:57.320 --> 05:01.880
be able to actually see their children and I had no idea how hard it was to be a teacher

05:01.880 --> 05:06.320
with all these kids and blah blah blah.

05:06.320 --> 05:12.720
Not blah blah blah, I'm sure she had points but we really, we're very, very good at disagreeing.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.920
We can disagree very strongly.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.800
I can see myself in my kid and I can see myself sitting at the kindergarten desk that she

05:21.800 --> 05:22.800
was sitting at.

05:22.800 --> 05:28.760
I can see the similarities and a lot of the similarities come down to an attribute that

05:28.760 --> 05:41.680
is slowness, like a real slowness that we share that has been like frustrating to teachers

05:41.680 --> 05:55.040
and parents and friends and lovers and roommates and any number of people.

05:55.040 --> 06:05.520
For instance, it really can and often does take me an hour to put on my shoes and I can't

06:05.520 --> 06:10.360
tell you where the time goes, it's not like I got distracted and started playing records

06:10.400 --> 06:17.200
or something, like I can sit in the same place putting on my socks and shoes for an hour.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.480
So can my daughter.

06:18.480 --> 06:26.880
We can lose weekends just sitting on the toilet and if there's an apartment where I spend

06:26.880 --> 06:35.880
time with my daughter, there's only one toilet so that's easy for me to see the similarities.

06:35.880 --> 06:40.920
Thinking about how we see our children and how we see ourselves and our children and

06:40.920 --> 06:45.200
how we want to see ourselves in a positive light, we don't want something to be wrong

06:45.200 --> 06:50.200
with our children.

06:50.200 --> 06:57.440
It makes me think about a moment in time when I was 17 years old and I was watching television

06:57.440 --> 07:05.600
with my father, episode of Nova, it's like a science program that was on, I think it

07:05.600 --> 07:09.880
was on PBS, I don't know if it still exists.

07:09.880 --> 07:20.440
This one was on neuroscience and neuroscience technology and there had a guy getting prepared

07:20.480 --> 07:29.400
for a CAT scan and being, receiving a CAT scan and it filled me with this crazy wave

07:29.400 --> 07:36.880
of like deja vu but not just regular deja vu, like deja vu mixed with dread and like sickness

07:36.880 --> 07:46.640
to my stomach and it was overwhelming and I couldn't stop thinking about it and wondering

07:47.480 --> 07:48.480
did I have a CAT scan?

07:48.480 --> 07:51.560
So I turned to my father and asked him if I had a CAT scan.

07:51.560 --> 07:58.360
He said no and fell back asleep and then I couldn't get out of my head and I started

07:58.360 --> 08:05.640
remembering more and more this experience of being a little kid and getting a CAT scan.

08:05.640 --> 08:12.920
I finally went to my mother, asked her and she didn't want to talk about it and I persisted

08:12.920 --> 08:22.120
and she admitted that I had had a CAT scan when I was six years old, something like that

08:22.120 --> 08:31.880
and I asked her why I had had a CAT scan and she didn't want to talk about it but she started

08:31.880 --> 08:43.280
laughing a little bit, which is weird, from where I was standing, kind of filled with

08:43.280 --> 08:53.480
dread and having this repressed memory come up and finally she admitted I had had a CAT

08:53.480 --> 08:55.080
scan and she told me why.

08:55.080 --> 09:07.520
She said that I was so slow that they thought that I was retarded and I'd be given a battery

09:07.520 --> 09:13.280
of tests to test my cognitive ability and the tests were inconclusive and they couldn't

09:13.280 --> 09:25.400
figure out, the jury's still out, trust me, but the tests were inconclusive so they thought

09:25.400 --> 09:33.400
that maybe I just had a brain tumor and so that's why I got the CAT scan.

09:33.400 --> 09:42.840
I don't know if you've ever had one but I don't even like giving blood for a blood test.

09:42.840 --> 09:49.560
I don't, this is actually, thinking about it right now, probably exactly why I hate

09:49.560 --> 09:55.840
Western medicine entirely and will do anything to stay away from a doctor.

09:55.840 --> 10:03.000
With a CAT scan, they have to like take your clothes off if you're little and you don't

10:03.000 --> 10:09.320
want to take your clothes off in a room full of strangers and then they, this is my memory

10:09.800 --> 10:16.520
so I don't know, they inject something into your ankle like an iodine solution and then

10:16.520 --> 10:24.480
they lay you on a table and you get slid into a tube that sends whatever rays through your

10:24.480 --> 10:30.880
body to look into your brain to see what's going on.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.960
Totally fucking terrifying.

10:34.960 --> 10:43.160
I remembered trying to escape, I remembered screaming until I was hoarse, I remembered

10:43.160 --> 10:51.800
my father coming into the room and talking me down and I remember having my clothes put

10:51.800 --> 10:59.080
back on and taken to the gift shop and my father bought me a book of animal limericks

10:59.200 --> 11:06.200
and rhymes and photographs of the animals, all these animals from North America, black

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
hard covered book.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.600
I remembered that book and I had it for childhood but I didn't remember anything about the CAT

11:11.600 --> 11:17.200
scan after I left the hospital because it sucked that bad.

11:17.200 --> 11:29.000
My parents loved, loved me, loved their children and that couldn't have been anything but

11:29.000 --> 11:39.280
painful and frightening from my father too, you know, the whole situation and so I'm just

11:39.280 --> 11:46.320
thinking about what motivated them to go to that extreme to see what was wrong with me.

11:46.320 --> 11:56.040
So it turns out that no brain tumor as a child, just slow, I'm just slow.

11:56.080 --> 12:02.960
I've figured out ways to live my life that it doesn't really matter as far as survival

12:02.960 --> 12:15.560
is concerned and actually I've been able to thrive, you know, by degrees and I had to

12:15.560 --> 12:23.160
think about that, it's so tempting to sing, so tempting to push it so past the time that

12:23.280 --> 12:28.720
she starts playing and I have to improvise a song on top of it to finish the story.

12:28.720 --> 12:33.600
I won't do that.

12:33.600 --> 12:41.400
Just thinking about not doing that to my child, you know, having the good fortune to have

12:41.400 --> 12:49.360
a child that's so much like me that I can take my experiences and help her, at least

12:49.360 --> 12:52.160
in this moment, I don't know what the future holds and I don't know who she's going to

12:52.160 --> 13:03.880
become, you know, but I can use my experience in a way to lessen her potential problems

13:03.880 --> 13:11.120
in this world, which is what you ultimately, ultimately, ultimately wish for as a parent.

13:11.120 --> 13:18.120
Her mother went to talk to the teacher a couple weeks later and came back horrified and wanted

13:18.120 --> 13:26.560
to, but she's not a violent person, but she wanted our daughter out too.

13:26.560 --> 13:30.520
So we took our daughter out of that school, she's now at a Steiner school, which really

13:30.520 --> 13:34.520
suits her much better and we're both slow.

0	4480	I reached over and secretly undid my seatbelt.
4480	7420	And when his foot hit the brake at the red light,
7420	9640	I flung open the door and I ran.
10860	13400	I had no shoes on, I was crying.
14380	18500	I had no wallet, but I was okay because I had my cigarettes.
20040	21680	And I didn't want any part of freedom
21680	23260	if I didn't have my cigarettes.
25160	27900	When you live with someone who has a temper,
28820	31740	a very bad temper, a very, very bad temper,
31740	35500	you learn to play around that.
35500	38380	You learn this time I'll play possum
38380	41140	and next time I'll just be real nice
41140	42620	or I'll say yes to everything
42620	45820	or you make yourself scarce or you run.
45820	48380	And this was one of the times when you just run.
49620	51460	And as I was running, I thought
51460	53200	this was a great place to jump out
53200	55340	because they were big lawns and they were cul-de-sacs
55340	56820	and sometimes he would come after me
56820	60060	and drive and yell stuff at me to get back in, get back in.
60060	62140	And I was like, no, I'm out of here.
62140	64300	This is great and I went and hid behind a cabana
64300	67460	and he left and I had my cigarettes.
67460	71320	And I started to walk in this beautiful neighborhood.
71320	76320	It was 10.30 at night and it was silent and lovely
77740	82600	and there was no sound except for sprinklers.
82600	85600	Ch, ch, ch, ch, prrrr, ch, ch, ch, ch.
87500	90100	Prrrr, and I was enjoying myself
90100	91500	and enjoying the absence of anger
91500	94900	and enjoying these few hours I knew I'd have of freedom.
94900	99620	And just to perfect it, I thought I'll have a smoke
99620	102780	and then it occurred to me with horrifying speed,
102780	103900	I don't have a light.
106420	110500	Just then, as if an answer, I see a figure up ahead.
110500	111820	Who is that?
111820	113180	It's not him, okay?
113180	114740	They don't have a dog, who is that?
115020	117500	What are they doing out on this suburban street?
117500	120660	And the person comes closer and I can see it's a woman.
120660	123900	And then I can see, she has her hands in her face.
123900	125020	Oh, she's crying.
125020	127620	And then she sees me and she composes herself
127620	130700	and she gets closer and I see she has no shoes on.
130700	132580	She has no shoes on and she's crying
132580	135240	and she's out on this strange street.
135240	138340	I recognize her, though I've never met her.
138340	142180	And just as she passes me, she says, you got a cigarette?
142180	143660	And I say, you got a light?
145140	147300	And she says, damn, I hope so.
147300	150780	And then first she digs into her cutoffs in the front,
150780	152380	nothing, and then digs in the back
152380	153820	and then she has this vest on
153820	155740	that has 50 million little pockets on it
155740	157860	and she's checking and checking and it's looking bad.
157860	159020	It's looking very bad.
160340	163360	She digs back in the front again, deep, deep,
163360	165620	and she pulls out a pack of matches
165620	167460	that have been laundered at least once.
169620	172300	We open it up and there is one match inside.
173180	174740	Okay, oh my God.
174740	176540	This takes on, it's like Nassau now.
176540	178380	We gotta like, how are we gonna do it?
178380	181620	Okay, and we hunker down, we crouch on the ground
181620	184260	and where's the wind coming from?
184260	185100	We're stopping.
185100	187100	I take out my cigarettes, let's get the cigarettes ready.
187100	189660	Oh, my brand, she says, not surprising.
189660	192200	And we both have our cigarettes at the ready.
192200	193980	She strikes once, nothing.
193980	196580	She strikes again, yes, fire.
196580	200500	Puff, inhale, sweet kiss of that cigarette.
200660	203820	And we sit there and we're loving the nicotine
203820	205940	and we both need this right now.
205940	208380	I can tell, the night's been tough.
208380	209900	Immediately we start to reminisce
209900	211780	about our 30 second relationship.
211780	213700	I didn't think that was gonna happen, me neither.
213700	215380	Oh, man, that was close.
215380	217300	Oh, I'm so lucky I saw you, yeah.
219580	223500	Then she surprises me by saying, what was the fight about?
224460	226700	And I say, what are they all about?
226700	228000	And she said, I know what you mean.
228000	229580	She said, was it a bad one?
229620	231380	And I said, you know, like medium.
232220	236340	She said, oh, and we start to trade stories about our lives.
236340	238400	We're both from up north.
238400	240940	We're both kind of newish to the neighborhood.
240940	242340	This is in Florida.
242340	244700	We both went to college, not grade colleges,
244700	246520	but man, we graduated.
246520	248740	And I'm actually finding myself a little jealous of her
248740	251840	because she has this really cool job washing dogs.
254220	256700	She had horses back home and she really loves animals
256700	257620	and she wants to be a vet.
257620	259460	I'm like, man, you're halfway there.
261900	264540	I'm a waitress at an ice cream parlor.
264540	266340	So that's not, I don't know where I want to be,
266340	268480	but I know it's not that.
268480	270300	And then it gets a little deeper
270300	273400	and we share some other stuff about what our lives are like.
273400	276580	Things that I can't ever tell people at home.
276580	279660	This girl, I can tell her the really ugly stuff
279660	282940	and she still understands how it can still be pretty.
282940	285960	She understands like how nice he's gonna be
285960	288620	when I get home and how sweet that'll be.
290400	292320	We are chain smoking off each other.
292320	293560	Oh, that's almost out, come on.
293560	296760	And we go through this entire pack until it's gone.
296760	299720	And then I say, you know what, this is a little funny,
299720	301800	but you're gonna have to show me the way to get home.
301800	303160	Because although I'm 23 years old,
303160	304960	I don't have my driver's license yet.
304960	307600	And I just jumped out right when I needed to.
307600	309560	And she says, well, why don't you come back to my house
309560	311320	and I'll give you a ride.
311320	312840	I said, okay, great.
312880	314200	And we start walking.
314200	318720	And we get to this, lots of lights
318720	321200	and the roads are getting wider and wider
321200	322400	and there's more cars.
322400	326160	And I see lots of stores, you know, laundry mats
326160	329120	and dollar stores and emergency centers.
329120	333120	And then we cross over US-1
333120	337420	and she leads me to someplace and I think, no.
337420	341380	But yes, Carl's Efficiency Apartments.
341380	342580	This girl lives there.
343440	345440	And it's horrible and it's lit up so bright
345440	347800	just to illuminate the horribleness of it.
347800	349640	It's the kind of place where you drive your car right up
349640	351000	and the door's right there.
351000	353240	And there's 50 million cigarette butts outside.
353240	355000	And there's like doors one through seven
355000	356400	and you know behind every single door
356400	358880	there's some horrible misery going on.
358880	361800	There's someone crying or drunk or lonely or cruel.
361800	364400	And I think, oh, she lives here, how awful.
365800	368160	We go to the door, door number four,
368160	371420	and she very, very quietly keys in.
372420	373540	As soon as the door opens,
373540	375260	I hear the blare of television come out
375260	377180	and on the blue light of the television,
377180	380900	the smoke of 100 cigarettes in that little crack of light.
380900	383860	And I hear the man and he says, where were you?
383860	386060	And she says, nevermind, I'm back.
386060	389020	And he says, you all right?
389020	390140	And she says, yeah, I'm all right.
390140	392060	And then she turns to me and says, you want a beer?
392060	393780	And he says, who the fuck is that?
394780	397500	And she pulls me over and he sees me and he says,
397500	399540	oh, hey, I'm not a threat.
400540	403300	Just then he takes a drag of his cigarette,
403300	405140	a very hard, hard drag, you know,
405140	407300	the kind that makes the end of it really heat up,
407300	409820	hot, hot, hot and long and it's a little scary.
409820	412580	And I follow the cigarette down
412580	414860	because I'm afraid of that head falling off.
414860	418440	And I'm surprised when I see in the crook of his arm,
418440	422100	a little boy sleeping, a toddler.
422100	424900	And I think, and just then the girl reaches
424900	427060	underneath the bed and takes out a carton
427060	430460	and she taps out the last pack of cigarettes in there.
430460	432700	And on the way up, she kisses the little boy
432700	434820	and then she kisses the man and the man says again,
434820	436300	you all right?
436300	438060	And she says, yeah, I'm just gonna go out
438060	439700	and smoke with her.
439700	442340	And so we go outside and sit amongst the cigarette butts
442340	446420	and smoke and I say, wow, that's your little boy.
446420	447900	She says, yeah, isn't he beautiful?
447900	451100	And I say, yeah, he is, he is beautiful.
451100	453460	He's my light, he keeps me going, she says.
455100	456900	We finish our cigarettes.
457740	459140	She finishes her beer, I don't have a beer
459140	461340	because I can't go home with beer on my breath.
462780	467380	And she goes inside to get the keys.
467380	469340	She takes too long in there getting the keys
469340	471300	and I think something must be wrong
471300	474300	and she comes out and she says, look, I'm really sorry
474300	477000	but we don't have any gas in the car,
477000	478640	it's already on E and he needs to get to work
478640	482700	in the morning and I'm gonna walk to work as it is.
482700	483820	So what I did was though, here look,
483820	485660	I drew out this map for you and you're really,
485660	487220	you're like a mile and a half from home
487220	488860	and if you walk three streets over,
488860	490140	you'll be back on that pretty street
490140	491780	and you just take that and you'll be fine.
491780	495160	And she also has wrapped up in toilet paper,
495160	499080	seven cigarettes for me, a third of her pack, I note,
499080	500640	and a new pack of matches.
501660	505140	And she tells me goodbye and that was great to meet you
505140	510140	and how lucky and that was fun and let's be friends.
510240	513300	And I say, yeah, okay, and I walk away
513300	515500	but I kinda know we're not gonna be friends.
516820	520740	I might not ever see her again and I kinda know,
520740	523500	I don't think she's ever gonna be a vet.
523500	526940	And I cross and I walk away and maybe this would've seemed
526940	529420	like a visit from my possible future and scary
529420	531780	but it kinda does the opposite on the walk home.
531780	535740	I'm like, man, that was really grim over there.
535740	540060	And I'm going home now to my nice boyfriend
540060	542740	and he is gonna be so extra happy to see me
542740	545500	and we have a one bedroom apartment
545500	548900	and we have two trees and there's a yard
548900	550500	and we have this jar in the kitchen
550500	552580	where there's like loose money that we can use for anything
552580	554540	like we would never ever run out of gas
554540	556760	and I don't have a baby, you know?
556760	559480	So I can leave whenever I want.
561020	564260	I smoked all seven cigarettes on the way home
564260	567180	and people who have never smoked cigarettes
567180	571000	just think, ick, disgusting and poison.
571000	574760	But unless you've had them and held them dear,
574760	576700	you don't know how great they can be
576700	580100	and what friends and comfort and kinship they can bring.
581120	585800	It took me a long time to quit that boyfriend
586960	589280	and then to quit smoking.
589280	592520	And sometimes I still miss the smoking.
593300	597260	Then I stay away from him because of the work and the pain.
597260	620840	And even the

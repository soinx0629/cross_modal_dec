1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,300
So, I'm sitting in my shrink's office this one time, and he says to me, how's it going?

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:20,100
And I say, well, to be honest, Doc, I had a really, really horrible experience the other

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,100
day.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,820
And he says, tell me about it.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,380
And I say, well, it all started when I was laying on my couch.

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,720
And he looks at me and he says, really?

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,520
Which if you know me, is an incredibly funny thing for him to say, because I have probably

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:48,140
spent more time lying on couches than any able-bodied man under the age of, say, 110

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,460
living today.

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:59,180
If lying on couches was a martial art, I would have a ninth-level black belt ninja master

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,100
status in it.

12
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,480
As a matter of fact, when I was originally asked by the moth to do this event, and they

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,600
explained about the seven deadly sins, I was amazed that sloth was even still available.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,340
I assumed that sloth would be the first sin picked, because it is really the central thing

15
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,920
about our culture, isn't it?

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:31,300
We live in a whole society based on consumer entertainment and luxury effort reduction.

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,840
But within that culture, my own generation, which they used to call Gen X or slackers,

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,000
really distinguished itself, even among the general culture.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,460
And within that elite group of underachievers, I distinguished myself as really a super-achiever

20
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,600
of underachievement.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,200
If sloth is a sin, I think it's fair to say I'm really guilty of, like, Milosevic-level

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,920
crimes against humanity.

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,680
And if the Vatican conducted its affairs the way that governments do, there would be some

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:17,700
sort of secret Vatican sniper up in these windows ready to take me out right now.

25
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,800
I lived for years and years and years just bumming around this wonderful college town

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
called Madison, Wisconsin.

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
And did people know Madison?

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Great.

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
That's fantastic.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,000
And we had a whole culture there that was essentially built around couches.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,880
Everything was centered around the living room, because what your life consisted of

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,920
was every second that you weren't slaving away at your shitty minimum wage job.

33
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,880
And that's, I'd like to dispel, a myth about slackers right now, which is that they don't

34
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,500
work hard.

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,480
Because in order to live a life of sloth, you really have to work like a slave to do

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
it.

37
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,160
Because opting out of the career rat race essentially means opting into the working

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,080
poor.

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,120
And so every second that you weren't at that job, you were sitting in your living room,

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,200
sitting with your friends, you're watching TV, you're smoking pot, you're listening

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,900
to rock and roll and watching DVDs, but mainly just engaging in conversation.

42
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:30,360
And you're trying to wring every last ounce of leisure, of luxury effort reduction out

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,120
of the remaining hours before your shift at the job you hate starts again.

44
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,600
We had a wonderful tradition in Madison, because every year when the students would move, the

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,320
frat guys would leave their furniture abandoned by the side of the road.

46
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:54,560
And so every year you would take the cigarette hole burned, beer stained, vomit smelling

47
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,920
couch that just stank like weed and cigarettes.

48
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,880
And you would pick it up and you'd march it out of the house and you'd set it down and

49
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,640
then you'd go get a brand new couch from the frat kids and you'd move it into the empty

50
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,040
space where you had the previous couch and you'd set it down and you'd have a wonderful

51
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,080
new couch to abuse for the following year.

52
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,180
Now one of the things I did during all these years of slacking in Madison was I was writing

53
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,480
jokes for The Onion and to my great surprise that eventually turned into a career.

54
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,440
And no one could have been more surprised about it than me, believe me.

55
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,200
And I ended up moving to New York and for the first time I had money, so I was incredibly

56
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,560
excited because I was not only going to be able to live this life of slack, but I was

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,520
going to be able to live it in style.

58
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:47,520
And I set up this wonderful apartment in Brooklyn, this nice living room and I filled it with

59
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,880
seating.

60
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,000
I bought a surround sound home theater and I got a DVD player for it.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I got a big TV and I got a fantastic number for a great connection with a top notch weed

62
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,320
delivery service.

63
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,680
And the best thing is I bought this fantastic, it was the couch of my dreams at this vintage

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,200
store.

65
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:20,560
I spent $500 on it, only couch I ever spent money on in my life.

66
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,920
And I was so looking forward to all the wonderful times I was going to have with all these great

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,840
new friends I was going to make in New York.

68
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,280
But what I didn't understand was that New York is not like Madison.

69
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,280
It's not a living room based town.

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,120
Because all of the Lower East Side downtown Bohemians that I was wanting to hang out with,

71
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,080
they don't have living rooms.

72
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,240
They have a box with a bed and a refrigerator and a toilet and a shower and a sink and that's

73
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,600
where they live.

74
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,800
And so in lieu of living rooms, they hang out in bars and restaurants.

75
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,040
And for that reason, it's also not a marijuana town, it's an alcohol town.

76
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,600
So I've had to learn to drink and I'm getting pretty good at it to be honest.

77
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,600
But none of those things really matter if, like me, you live in Brooklyn, but people

78
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,920
from Manhattan won't go to Brooklyn.

79
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,440
Because it's a 20 minute ride on the train and they're busy spending 40 to 80 minutes

80
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,420
waiting to get into the cool restaurant or bar.

81
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,740
So the upshot of all this is I spend about the next five years of my life in the ultimate

82
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,020
slack pad I've created, surrounded by empty seats, alone, playing video games, watching

83
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,100
DVDs, by myself.

84
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,580
Surrounded by empty seating.

85
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,580
And what's worse is that my DVD player even mocks me because whenever you hit stop a screen

86
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,580
saver comes on with their consumer entertainment home theater slogan that says everyone's invited.

87
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,300
Everyone's invited.

88
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:09,300
Every day, everyone's invited, but you're here by yourself, aren't you?

89
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,740
Over the years, the combined effects of A, gravity, B, time, and C, my ass on this couch,

90
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,900
literally destroy my dream couch.

91
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,940
The part of the couch where my ass is centered has collapsed completely.

92
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,900
There's like springs and metal falling out the bottom, stuffing is falling out the bottom.

93
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,740
There's just a hole where my ass is.

94
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,900
I have to fill it up with pillows and blankets and put a board over it just to continue to

95
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:48,900
lay on it.

96
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,260
At this point in this story, I'm sure that those of you in the audience with even a remote

97
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,860
sense of insight into the human condition are probably thinking to yourself, well, you

98
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,900
know, these stories are all kind of cute anecdotes and they're a little bit funny, but I have

99
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,500
another interpretation of everything this man on stage is saying and it sounds kind

100
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,220
of to me like he's describing the behavior of someone who is, not to put too fine a point

101
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,740
on it, clinically depressed.

102
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,140
And you would be right.

103
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,900
I happen to have been clinically depressed pretty much my entire adult life, which brings

104
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,620
us back to why I was sitting in my shrink's office in the first place telling him about

105
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,660
this horrible experience.

106
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,300
So he says, tell me about it.

107
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,380
I say, I'm laying on the couch and it was one of those days when you've run out of all

108
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,460
the distractions available in the living room.

109
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:46,460
Like I had watched all the DVDs, I had finished all the video games, I had masturbated to

110
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:53,700
all of the available pornography, I had smoked all the drugs, there was nothing left.

111
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:00,940
And I had a moment of zen stillness and clarity where I was face to face with myself.

112
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:08,340
And I looked in myself and I saw this horrific, nightmarish void of nothingness.

113
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,880
It was just this swirling vortex of empty zero.

114
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,340
There was nothing there.

115
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,320
I felt like I had no future, no past, no options, no hope.

116
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,720
Like there was nothing to believe in.

117
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,880
And at this point my shrink cuts me off and he says, Todd, Todd, wait, wait, hold on.

118
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,160
Right now I'm hearing a lot of negativity from you.

119
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I mean, you're just describing a horrible descent into nihilism.

120
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,000
And I give him this look like, well, duh, you know, and I say, yeah, the reason you're

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,280
hearing that is because that's what I'm telling you.

122
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,040
And he says, well, Todd, but that's very serious.

123
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,240
Nihilism is a terrible place to end up.

124
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,880
Bad things happen to people that go there.

125
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,720
You can drown in that shit.

126
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,840
So I say, well, let me tell you, do I hear a cell phone?

127
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,440
Is that what that is?

128
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,280
So I tell him, maybe someone's just giving me a little hip hop background to this.

129
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,240
So I tell him, well, let me finish the story.

130
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,640
Have you ever been so depressed that you just can't get out of bed or you just can't

131
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,120
get out of your chair and you just end up relying on whatever's in arm's reach of you,

132
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,880
you know?

133
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,120
And so I'm sort of groping around the couch just looking for something, anything to distract

134
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,380
me from this horrible emptiness that I'm experiencing.

135
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,240
And I reach under the couch and I find this old paperback book that has been kicked under

136
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,440
there probably a couple months earlier and I pull it out and it's the ultimate perfect

137
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,840
book for lifting someone out of their own personal hell.

138
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:57,400
Happens to be, swear to God this is true, not making this up, Dante's Inferno.

139
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,000
So I'm like, I obviously cannot handle reading Dante's Inferno right now.

140
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,200
But lacking anything else to do, I decide I'm going to read the foreword.

141
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:13,280
So the foreword is written by some scholar of medieval Italian epic poetry or whatever.

142
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,360
And I start reading it and I say to my doc, as I was reading it, I learned a new word.

143
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,120
He says, what was it?

144
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,760
And I said, well, the word is acedia.

145
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,280
I'd never heard of this word before.

146
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,000
And he says, what does it mean?

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,720
I said, well, it was the medieval Catholic's word for the profound sense of emptiness that

148
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,040
comes from not believing in anything.

149
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:45,840
They saw it as a sin and specifically the sin of the failure, they defined it as the

150
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,480
failure to pursue God.

151
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:57,360
In other words, a lack of making the effort necessary to seek out the joy of God or more

152
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,280
generally of creation.

153
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,160
And it was considered so dangerous that they actually numbered it among the seven deadly

154
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
sins, acedia.

155
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,920
And by the way, I don't know if it's actually pronounced acedia because I'm a college dropout.

156
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,440
I don't know how to pronounce ancient Latin.

157
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,800
Granted, I knew I was going to be speaking in front of a couple hundred people.

158
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:29,200
I probably could have Googled it and figured out the pronunciation, but I was too lazy.

159
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,760
And at this point, I can tell that my shrink is a little uncomfortable with how the conversation

160
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,960
is going because he doesn't like talking about sin.

161
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:45,720
He doesn't like sin doctrine based modes of behavioral modification because he's a shrink.

162
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,680
And shrinks are always against thinking about things in terms of sin because sin is always

163
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
about guilt.

164
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,900
And a shrink's job is to get people to get over guilt.

165
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,520
So he's kind of trying to change the subject.

166
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:04,100
But what I say to him is the amazing thing about this is that in modern times, it's usually

167
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:16,020
translated or mistranslated, if you will, as sloth because it involves a lack of effort.

168
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,820
But the idea is, you know, when we hear sloth now, I mean, it just seems like laziness.

169
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,860
It's not that big of a sin.

170
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,020
It's not deadly.

171
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,500
But they were talking about something far more serious.

172
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,300
They were talking about a deep existential despair.

173
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Thanks.

174
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:44,780
And I realized as I was talking to him that if I'm guilty of acedia, then so is our whole

175
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,240
consumer entertainment prozac taken depressed out of their mind nation.

176
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,140
And I figured there's two ways of looking at it.

177
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:58,900
Either we should be very grateful that ancient Catholic doctrine doesn't still dominate the

178
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,380
because if so, then me and the whole nation are all just guilty, unredeemable sinners

179
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,100
and can be written off.

180
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,300
But the second way of looking at it is perhaps a little more productive is that this was

181
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,180
a way of looking at my depression that didn't involve me being a helpless victim of a sickness

182
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,820
defined by a condition and that I might have some degree of personal responsibility for

183
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,740
my own state of mind.

184
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,860
So my shrink looks at me and he doesn't say anything for a very long time because he doesn't

185
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,220
like how the conversation's going.

186
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,460
But on the other hand, he's a smart guy.

187
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,860
So he's thinking very, very intently.

188
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,920
And finally, he looks up at me and he says, that's very interesting.

189
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,300
What are you going to do about it?

190
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:51,700
And I look back at him and I say, hmm, thank you.

0	8420	So I get a phone call from my mom and she tells me that my father is about to
8420	15700	get on an emergency life flight from our home in Montana to go to Denver to get
15700	24660	an emergency liver transplant. My mom is kind of perennially optimistic and she's
24660	27620	telling me don't worry it's gonna be okay we're gonna pull through this it's
27620	33740	gonna be alright but I know something is really wrong so I get the next flight I
33740	40180	can to go from where I'm leaving here in New York hoping that I get there before
40180	46260	my father dies and I'm really glad I got that flight as fast as I did because I
46260	52820	was able to spend a couple hours with my father before he passed away and before
52820	59540	I know it I'm at this side of his hospital bed with my mom and we're
59540	69440	sobbing because he's passed. My dad was a he was a strong silent type he was he
69440	75580	was a grew up on a farm and he was the town one of one of two town eye doctors
75580	81340	so he could fix anything you know he could fix tractors or eyes he can you
81340	85660	know no matter what and he was always doing it like behind the scenes you know
85660	94020	he never wanted to take credit for it. It was apparent that my mom and I and my
94020	99220	two brothers were gonna have to be fixing things ourself this time around
99220	105060	and the first thing my mom did was was to call my two brothers one's a year
105060	111420	older one is a year younger and it was gonna be really comforting to see my
111420	117060	younger brother we were really close it was gonna he was really gonna support
117060	124340	me it was gonna be much more complicated seeing my older brother we'd always had
124340	131300	a really complicated relationship and there was something really big about me
131300	138300	that he did not know and that's that the last time he saw me years and years
138300	146300	before I was male he was not aware that I had transitioned from being male to
146300	153340	being female and you know I always wanted to tell him I was trying to find
153340	160540	the right time the right place trying to you know get up the nerve I was worried
160540	165700	about his reaction maybe that you know he was a bit conservative he had a
165700	169900	temper I didn't know how it's gonna happen and I just kept putting it off
169900	176740	and never found the right time and here we are at the time where I have to deal
176740	181940	with all this stuff. Mark wasn't the only one who didn't know my story my whole
181940	189460	hometown didn't know about me either and you know I was trying to find a way to
189580	193340	tell Mark I just kind of figured with my hometown I just I just would never go
193340	200540	back there again so my mom calls my brother and in one phone call tells him
200540	212900	that he lost his father and then he now has a sister and I have to say I mean
212900	217420	Mark was he was really great he he got off the plane we met him at the airport
217660	226140	he gave me a hug but it was awkward as you can imagine and you know I think we
226140	229460	did what a lot of families do at times like that you just kind of fall back on
229460	238780	tradition and we wanted to do something that my mom and dad had always done
238780	246260	every year because you see it was my father's birthday he had passed away 20
246260	257660	minutes before before his 65th birthday so we all went to Applebee's and we got
257660	264700	a slice of sizzling apple pie and put a candle in it and my brother Mark who
264700	271060	really worshiped my father got the honor of blowing out the candle and when he
271060	274980	was blowing out the can I'm still remember the expression on his face he
274980	281540	was you know trying to process my father's passing he was figuring out
281540	286500	why it had been so long that the two of us hadn't talked something that really
286500	296180	frustrated him and it was just all kind of coming together I took a business
296180	302100	card out of my purse it was for this job that Mark didn't even know I had I had
302100	307660	my new name on it and I wrote my cell phone number on it and I gave it to
307660	312740	Mark I said look you know we haven't talked for so long but here anytime any
312740	318460	place no barriers call me anywhere you know we can talk anytime you want and my
318460	327180	mom started crying because her you know her children were reuniting and also
327180	331980	because you know for years she had been running interference between the two of
331980	336700	us and using every excuse in the book to explain why I wasn't getting back to
336700	341900	him or why you know packages to me were being returned because they had the
341900	348980	wrong name on them and if you know her job running interference was over so
348980	354020	Mark was in shock we were all in shock I was in shock because I was thinking
354020	362700	about the fact that you know nobody in my hometown knew and I'm wondering if I
362700	370420	can go back for the for the funeral if I if I should go back if my mom and my
370420	377460	brothers really want me to really deep down and I'm thinking that you know I
377460	382020	never even thought I was gonna go back to my hometown and now I'm being I'm
382020	391820	being pulled back right into it as contradictory as it may seem as soon as
391820	397700	there was a reason to go back I had this really deep strong yearning to go back I
397700	403420	mean I I had gone to school in New York and San Francisco and traveled all over
403420	408100	the world and this place that I thought of as home that I think I've really
408100	412900	repressed knowing that I couldn't go back there right I didn't I don't need
412900	416700	to go back there but as soon as there was a reason for me to go back there a
416700	422100	very strong reason I really really wanted to go I wanted to see the house
422100	427700	the only house I had ever known growing up I wanted to go back to my hometown and
427700	431740	these people that you know comprises community that I thought of as home
431740	441460	right and my mom reassured me that she she wanted me to be there that she in
441460	447100	fact needed me there for support my brothers too and my mom had a plan to get
447100	452140	us there you know our family had been separated for a long time so she had the
452140	460080	idea for all of us to rent a car and drive the 20 hours from Denver back to
460080	465120	Montana so before you know it there we are in the car you know my brother hasn't
465120	471720	seen me for years especially not as female and here we are and we we had so
471720	477000	much to do we were planning we were planning his service my father's funeral
477000	483880	service we were writing his obituary my mom wanted to figure out and I did too
483880	488120	want to figure out how we could introduce the information about me while
488120	494000	still keeping the focus on my father so she had me driving out in the you know
494000	500320	across Wyoming 70 miles an hour she had me take dictation of her friends and she
500320	506320	wanted to invite them over for tea so she had this really strategic list it's
506320	509680	like you invite Judy and she's going to tell all the people in the arts
509680	513880	community that my mom was involved in and you're gonna tell June and June is
513880	517040	gonna tell all the people at dad's office and we'll find somebody else and
517040	524440	she's gonna tell everybody at the church and the next night there they
524440	531040	were 18 of my mom's best friends and the minister from the church where the
531040	538480	service was gonna be performed they're drinking tea my mom says you all know
538480	546000	very well by now that I've lost my husband and I know a lot of you have
546000	556920	wondered what happened to my middle son who seemed to disappear and she said I
556920	563920	want you to know tonight that yeah I have a daughter and her name is Kim and
563920	571440	this is my child and I love my child and I hope you do too and we can focus on
571440	578280	this tonight we can talk about this tonight you all are my ambassadors if
578280	584160	someone has questions at the funeral and I'm caught up in things I want I'm going
584160	588480	to point them to you and let you tell this story because you can talk about it
588480	597860	in a sensitive way and she you know took a couple a couple questions from the
597860	605260	people there and the whole tea party and did slightly different than the tea
605260	613300	party we hear about in the news the whole thing ended with everybody raising
613300	618260	their teacups and saying hip hip hooray for Kim hip hip hooray for Kim there
618260	623140	were a couple amens and some applause and and then everybody went home and I
623140	630100	swear there was a brown out from all the simultaneous phone calls that were being
630100	636980	made dispensing the information right so then the next thing there was a viewing
636980	643820	of my father's body at the funeral home and I had elected not to go because you
643820	647060	know I didn't want the focus to be on me I was going to keep it on everybody and
647060	652780	keep it on my father but my best friend Tim from high school was at the viewing
652780	661740	and he calls me up he had only known the new me for a couple days I hadn't even
661740	669460	told him but he knew me really well and he knew I was chickening out and he
669460	674540	called me from the funeral parlor and he said hey I got a lot of people here
674540	681300	they really want to see you I should probably tell you that the people he's
681340	690820	talking about are the football team because I used to be on the football team and so
690820	707100	applause and so Tim says where are you I got a lot of people want to see you I'm
707100	710780	like yeah I don't want to go and you know I want to keep the focus on my dad
710780	715260	I don't want to be he's like yeah yeah whatever either you come down here or
715260	722740	we're gonna come up there what's it gonna be I said I come up here I guess so
722740	729660	before I know it the football team is at my front door and a couple of them have
729660	735500	cases of beer under their arm one case gets tossed in the snowbank to keep it
735500	740220	cold it's just like high school and all of a sudden they're in my living room
740220	747060	and it's this wake instantly and this show of support for me and for the
747060	753620	memory of my father right and they're in my living room this living room I never
753620	760700	even thought I would see again and people were either laughing or crying
760700	766340	mostly laughing and I remember looking around the room and there's there's
766340	773820	Kevin he was one of the co-captains of the football team with me and I look
773820	778580	over there and there's my brothers Mark and Todd and they were you know we were
778580	782220	all very close in age so we had friends in common and they're telling stories
782220	795460	about my dad and there's I look over on the couch and there's Frank probably
795460	800820	should have all you also told you that not only was I on the football team but
800820	812100	I was the quarterback and so I look over on the couch and there's Frank he's
812100	817700	an offensive lineman it's the job of an offensive lineman to protect the
817700	825620	quarterback and Frank is protecting me once again 20 years later under very
825620	834220	different circumstances and he's got his arm around my girlfriend they're laughing
834220	839900	and knocking back cans of cheap beer and that was the moment that I knew things
839900	846020	were gonna be okay somehow and there was one more person there that night and
846020	852260	that was my mom and she told me something that we ended up repeating
852260	859580	quite a bit that weekend through the services she came up and she said you
859580	869020	know dad was always fixing things and it looks like he fixed this too she said
869020	877820	you know even though your father has died you've been reborn thank you very
877820	879980	much

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
All right, thank you very much.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,540
All right, this is my story.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,560
I was dating this girl like two years ago.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,600
Been dating her for like eight months

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,600
since she wanted to meet my parents.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,440
She was really giving me shit,

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,240
like, how come I haven't met your parents?

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,760
And, you know, I always just, I never liked,

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,880
you know, I never brought anybody home

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,720
to meet my parents, I was like 30 years old.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,160
Never met, brought anybody home.

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,020
Never, I didn't ever like meeting people in general.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,600
God, I didn't want to meet her parents.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,440
I always hated when you had to meet,

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,520
like, you know, go out with somebody,

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,280
you gotta like meet their friends and shit.

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,760
You know, sitting at the table trying to be interesting.

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,280
I usually end up just sitting there staring at

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,620
like mashed potatoes or some shit.

20
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,680
So she's like, you know, how come, what's wrong with you?

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,560
You know, how come you don't want to meet me, you know,

22
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,560
bring you home to meet your parents?

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,040
I started thinking about it, like, you know,

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,600
not only had I never brought anybody home,

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,580
you know, a girl home, and I was 30 years old,

26
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,680
I'd never brought anybody home.

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,200
Even like back in like first grade,

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,760
like second grade, I may have friends and shit,

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,920
I just never brought them home.

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,160
So I started thinking like, you know,

31
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,280
how the hell did that start?

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,360
You know, as you know, so we're basically driving up

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,440
from New York to go to my house to finally meet my parents.

34
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,760
And I remember like, I think it was like

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,000
when I was first grade, we used to have a bus stop,

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,360
and it was like right out in front of my house,

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,720
so my parents used to always be arguing.

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,080
My dad was like a maniac, you know,

39
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,920
God damn fucking bitch, you know, just total psycho.

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,440
My dad was like a complete psychopath, you know,

41
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,000
like his nickname in my house was called The Thing.

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,040
Because that's what he was, he was like,

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,360
he was this fucking thing that like, if he wasn't around,

44
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,920
we'd say, dude, is The Thing home?

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,320
You know, if he wasn't home, he could chill.

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,800
He was just like never in a good mood.

47
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,120
So one day I'm down at the bus stop,

48
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,240
there's like, you know, 10 other kids down there and shit,

49
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,380
we're all like in first grade, second grade,

50
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,000
third grade waiting for the bus.

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,200
And it's like towards the summertime,

52
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,760
my parents got like the windows open and shit.

53
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,120
So I can start to hear like an argument start,

54
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,280
and I'm like, well, what the fuck do you mean,

55
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,640
you didn't know?

56
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
And I'm sitting there like, please,

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,520
please let the bus come, please, for Christ's sake.

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,080
And all of a sudden, you're a goddamn fucking bitch,

59
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,480
yeah, screaming and shit.

60
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,400
And I remember just looking at all the other kids' looks

61
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,160
on their faces, like, I guess, you know,

62
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,440
this is like way before cable,

63
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,960
so most kids never even heard curses.

64
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,080
They couldn't believe it.

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
And I was just, that's when it really hit me,

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,000
that man, my family's really screwed up.

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,720
And I started going over other kids' houses

68
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,540
and their parents seemed to get along, they were like, cool.

69
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,960
And so the whole time I'm driving back,

70
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,600
my girlfriend coming up, all this stuff is like coming back

71
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,760
and I'm thinking, and I'm like really getting like,

72
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,000
oh, like I'm a six-year-old kid again,

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,280
like getting all nervous, like how my dad is gonna like act,

74
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,400
because it's like embarrassing, you know?

75
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,320
I mean, I remember like he was one of these dudes

76
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
where like, I don't know, he's just always in a bad mood,

77
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,480
like if he tried to like teach you something,

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,640
he'd say it once, and then when you didn't get it,

79
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,240
he'd just say it louder and louder.

80
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,720
And I remember six, he's going, this guy, he's retarded.

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,200
Like I remember we got a dog

82
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,920
and he's trying to teach his dog how to sit, all right?

83
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,520
It's a dog, it doesn't speak English,

84
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
and he's sitting there going,

85
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,980
and he's like, all right, sit, this little puppy, sit.

86
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,340
Sit down, you're gonna get over there

87
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,540
and you're gonna sit down.

88
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,300
Dog's sitting there like walking around like peeing,

89
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,500
like what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

90
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,900
And that was like his thing, man,

91
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
everything like in my house,

92
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,660
my parents, they were like ridiculously strict.

93
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,960
They had all these stupid rules,

94
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,340
like I remember they had like this one rule,

95
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,020
whatever you didn't eat for dinner,

96
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,860
they would just like wrap it in cellophane

97
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,580
and you had to like eat it the next morning for breakfast.

98
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,340
And there's like, everybody's sitting there

99
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,680
eating their like pancakes and waffles.

100
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,880
You're like eating like cube steaks and shit.

101
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,320
Dad be going, come on, eat it.

102
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,160
I don't want to eat it.

103
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,000
Eat it!

104
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,520
So I'm like driving back and that's all I'm thinking,

105
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,480
it's like, God, this guy's just gonna

106
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,800
completely embarrass me.

107
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,600
And I don't know, like it's just,

108
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,480
I just felt weird, like my family was like,

109
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,080
like the, you know, most famous like loving,

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,200
like build somebody up, like our family was just,

111
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,240
all of us just like ripping somebody down.

112
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,840
Like, I think the worst thing he ever did to me,

113
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,680
this is the one that really kind of made me like

114
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,920
the anxious, like worrisome person that I am.

115
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,240
I remember, it was right around Christmas.

116
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,080
I was really thinking this,

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,480
because I was driving this girl up for Christmas.

118
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,040
He, he was giving me shit one day.

119
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,760
He always hated when I was joking around.

120
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,520
I think making my mother laugh somehow was,

121
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
I don't know, bug him or whatever.

122
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,480
So he kept giving me shit.

123
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,920
Come on, man, you know, keep joking around, you know,

124
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,360
giggling all the time, you're acting like a little girl.

125
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,120
And I'm thinking like, cause he's always fucking with me,

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
I'm going, God, here's a new angle.

127
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,280
You know, you're asking for a football for Christmas,

128
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,160
you're acting like a little girl,

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,000
what the fuck's wrong with you?

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,840
And I'm just sitting there going, geez.

131
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,440
So like two weeks later, it's Christmas time,

132
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,320
I got like four brothers, right?

133
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,920
We always sneak down to go look at the presents.

134
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
So we go downstairs, right?

135
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,240
There's all these gifts down there all wrapped,

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,440
we're all looking to see who got what, you know?

137
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,800
There's all these little tags, to Ed from Santa.

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,960
You know, be like, you know, to Bob from Mama Dad or whatever.

139
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
And I'm sitting there.

140
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Just wait a second.

141
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,320
So I look, in like the middle of the tree,

142
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,600
I see there's a doll.

143
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
And I'm thinking, I got four brothers,

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
what the fuck is there, a doll sitting here?

145
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,520
And I remember just looking at this thing,

146
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,000
you ever see like those Spike Lee movies

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,240
where like the background moves and the character doesn't?

148
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,440
You just, it's like one of those deals.

149
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,000
And I look up at this doll, right?

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
And it says, to Bill from Santa.

151
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,800
And I'm like, what the fuck?

152
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,240
Guy got me a goddamn doll.

153
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,200
He came downstairs and he's laughing and shit,

154
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,240
and he's making me take a picture.

155
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,440
I'm like six years old and crying and stuff.

156
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,000
And I'm thinking of this shit,

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,280
as I'm pulling into the driveway,

158
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm like freaking out,

159
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,040
because I'm finally gonna bring somebody home

160
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,760
to meet this fucking maniac.

161
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,720
And I'm telling her, you know,

162
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,440
I don't know how this guy's gonna be or whatever.

163
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
So we're walking to the house, you know,

164
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,360
it's like candles and shit, you know, Christmas tree,

165
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,320
it's all real nice, dim lights and stuff.

166
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,840
She comes in, she meets my dad,

167
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,040
and the dude is like totally normal.

168
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,600
After me building this guy up the whole ride back,

169
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,720
he's like fucking like, you know,

170
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,120
that dude from Leave It to Beaver.

171
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,560
He's like the nicest guy ever.

172
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,880
He's all cordial.

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,840
And I remember I'm just getting like pissed at the guy.

174
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
Go, why isn't he being a dick?

175
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,960
And she's sitting there and taking me aside,

176
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,440
going, he's the greatest guy.

177
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,640
I can't believe you're saying all that stuff.

178
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,400
He's such, you know, he's smart, he's intelligent,

179
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,360
he's so interested in what I have to say.

180
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,920
I remember I was like, I was so pissed at the guy.

181
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
I mean, I really hated him when I was growing up.

182
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,200
To the point, I remember one time he went out on the driveway

183
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,880
and he's running out to his car,

184
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,920
and he slipped and fell and broke his shoulder.

185
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,840
And at that point, me and my brother

186
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,080
so fucking hated this guy.

187
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,920
When he came to the house,

188
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,400
my mother's like taking care of him.

189
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,800
We snuck out the back door

190
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,120
to look at his footprints in the snow

191
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,480
to see where he slipped and fell.

192
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,800
And I'm telling you, we were laughing our asses off

193
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,640
at this guy.

194
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,800
You're right there, right there, that's my brother.

195
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,600
Fuck, why couldn't I have seen that?

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,840
So,

197
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,040
so he ended up being like the sweetest guy ever

198
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,560
and there was nothing anxious about it.

199
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,600
I like worried about it for like,

200
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,560
I don't know, from the beginning of the time,

201
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,760
dating girls was like 15

202
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,360
and I just ended up feeling really stupid.

203
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,320
And I was kind of pissed.

204
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,160
I was just looking at the guy going,

205
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,280
oh, why the fuck couldn't you have been like this

206
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,520
20 years ago when I needed him to be like that

207
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,400
rather than being the way he was?

208
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,520
And that's my story, thanks.

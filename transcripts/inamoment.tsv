980	4800	I love numbers.
4800	8800	I love how straightforward and direct they are.
8800	12660	I love how one plus one is always equals to two,
12660	17660	and how two plus two, without a doubt, equals to four.
17840	19960	And so when it was time for us to decide
19960	23200	what we wanted to do in university,
23200	27360	I knew for sure that I wanted to work with numbers.
27360	30320	So you can imagine my joy when I heard
30320	34420	about something called actuarial science.
39760	43140	For those of you who do not know what that is,
43140	46080	it's this really amazing course
46080	48640	that has you spending your days doing things
48640	52720	like calculus and probability and statistics.
52720	57000	It's what insurance companies use to know
57040	58960	the mortality rates, hence tell you
58960	61000	how much premium you need to pay.
61000	64640	It's what governments use to know what areas to invest.
64640	66440	I mean, who wouldn't want to spend
66440	68440	the rest of their lives doing that?
73480	77220	But just before I went to university,
77220	80040	I was diagnosed with epilepsy.
80040	83200	And the doctor told me that I had to make sure
83200	85160	I did three things.
85200	90000	Ate well, slept well, and never missed my medication.
90000	92440	So under the doctor's advice,
92440	95760	I enrolled to do actuarial science
95760	97960	at the University of Nairobi.
98900	101460	A few years into it, I was lucky enough
101460	105280	to get an internship at an insurance company.
105280	107680	I remember my first day there.
107680	112520	I had a mismatched suit, but it was a suit nevertheless.
112520	116480	And the director's assistant was assigned
116480	118040	to show me around.
118040	120360	And since we were almost the same age,
120360	123080	we quickly clicked and made it a routine
123080	125520	to come very early in the morning
125520	128060	just to share our dreams and ambitions.
129140	131200	A few weeks into the job,
131200	134660	the company got a really big business deal,
134660	137520	which meant all of us had to chip in.
137520	139960	And we spent one Friday afternoon
140040	144780	learning how to use this new fancy photocopying machine.
146000	149560	On Saturday morning when reported for duty,
149560	152760	I got the honorable duty of working
152760	155060	with a new photocopying machine.
156520	158960	I remember walking into the copier room
158960	162040	armed with a room of papers and a stack of files
162040	164160	that I needed to photocopy.
164160	167160	I opened the machine just to make sure
167160	170160	it had enough papers as we had been instructed
170160	171180	the day before.
174400	176360	Then I woke up in the hospital.
179300	181960	And the doctor told me that I have something called
181960	183900	photosensitive epilepsy.
185200	189040	This is a type that is triggered by flashing lights
189040	193920	and in my case, with the beam from the photocopying machine.
194880	197760	And since I had a known history of epilepsy,
197760	201080	the doctor said that there was no need for me to be admitted
201080	204240	and that I should go home and get some rest.
204240	206600	So I went home, got some rest,
206600	208600	and was looking forward to Monday morning
208600	210920	to redeem myself at the workplace.
212260	215000	On Monday morning, I went back to the office
215000	217680	and the director's assistant told me
217680	221220	that I had been given two weeks to get more rest.
222180	223860	I was really excited about this
223860	227300	because here I was doing my dream job
227300	231340	and I was working for a company that cared about my health.
231340	233660	And so I went home and I did some research
233660	236100	on this photosensitive epilepsy
236100	238860	so that I could make sure it never happens
238860	240940	in the workplace again.
240940	244420	And after the two weeks, I went back to work
244420	247800	and the director's assistant told me
247800	250400	that they'd given me two more weeks.
251540	255860	This time around, I wasn't as excited as I was before.
255860	258220	For some reason, deep within me,
258220	260940	this two plus two was not adding up to four.
263260	266020	And so in the evening, after work hours,
266020	268840	I called the director's assistant
268840	272580	and I asked her if she had heard anything about my case.
275900	279700	And after a few minutes of silence
280660	283140	in what was almost like a whisper,
284060	285360	she said to me,
287540	291620	Sitawa, the director said that
291620	293860	we cannot work with someone like you.
295760	297700	This meant that they couldn't work with someone
297700	299460	with a health condition like mine.
301620	303860	And after a few more moments of silence,
303860	308120	she said that he was thinking of telling the person
308120	311200	who'd introduced me to this insurance company
311200	312720	to break the news to me.
315400	318900	I can't really recall how that fun conversation ended.
318900	322120	I don't know if she hung up first or if I hung up first,
322120	325740	but I remember bursting out into tears.
328860	333440	And I cried because of the pain I felt
333440	335960	that the director of this insurance company
335960	339320	did not have the courage or the integrity to tell me
339320	343040	to my face that I didn't have a job anymore,
343040	345880	but he kept giving me two and two more weeks off.
348360	353360	But most of all, I cried because I didn't ask for this.
355920	357720	I just started falling down.
358600	361600	And so after a few days of crying,
361600	363960	I turned my tears into words
363960	366080	and moved those words to a blog.
366080	367520	And before I knew it,
367520	371080	people living with epilepsy were coming to my blog
371080	373760	for inspiration and information and support.
373760	375440	And as the numbers grew,
375440	376880	I started a hotline
376880	380400	and they were able to get prompt support from it.
383400	386200	And so I started writing my own blog.
386200	391200	I still love numbers.
395120	397200	I love the truth in them.
398120	402880	I love the fact that numbers tell us things about people.
402880	405920	And from the numbers I have interacted with,
405920	409600	I see a future where people like me living with epilepsy
409600	411760	increase in their workplace.
411760	414880	I also see a future where people working with us
414880	416720	know that they can work with us
416720	417760	and they can touch us
417760	419800	and they'll not get this thing that we have.
419800	421240	And this thing that we have
421240	423440	only puts us down for a little while
423440	425360	and after that we are able to rise up
425360	427680	to contribute to the wellbeing
427680	430080	of this amazing world that we live in.

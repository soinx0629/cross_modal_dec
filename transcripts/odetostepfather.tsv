0	1840	Under the Influence is our topic tonight.
1840	3920	And I thought of a lot of different things.
3920	10480	And the one I kind of wanted to talk about was my secret influence.
10480	15140	There are people in our lives that are incredibly important to us.
15140	19660	And I would even mention to say some of the most important people, everybody aside
19660	23780	from my mother in my life, doesn't know anything about this person who I think
23780	26500	about every day, and his name was Michael Marquis.
26540	30580	And so if this were a violin piece, it would be called Ode to Michael Marquis.
30960	33540	I met him when I was seven years old.
34480	40580	And I was growing up, my mother had left my father when I was about two or three.
41060	47020	And this was the first man that my mother had brought home, like for me to meet.
47500	50400	And he was a Vietnam vet.
50960	53200	He was a professional athlete.
53400	56860	He had played college football, college baseball.
56860	60440	He was a ski instructor and a golf instructor.
60920	66300	He had like a big beard, and he drank scotch, and he had a German shepherd, and he had a lab,
66720	68920	and he had this unbelievable MG.
69140	73940	And not like those little like wussy MG's that you see, like it was like a 1933 MG.
73940	75000	It was like a motorcycle.
75100	77000	I mean, this thing was so cool.
77000	80660	And the doors like went super low, you know.
80660	82280	I mean, it was just so cool.
82540	83760	And he was so cool.
84200	91620	And he was the first person to really tap into, he may have tapped into it,
91620	94840	he may have created it, I'm not sure, but a mama's boy complex.
96560	102220	Which was that I had, I hadn't been, my father lived in Texas,
102220	105580	and I hadn't been to Texas since I was about three, but I was obsessed.
105580	107180	I had a Dallas Cowboys belt buckle.
107400	112320	I would wear like, you know, flower t-shirts, you know,
112320	114520	like Grand Parsons or something like that.
114520	116480	I mean, this is about 1977.
116480	117480	I was very into that.
117480	119840	I only listened to Willie Nelson's The Red-Headed Stranger.
120260	124860	My room was covered with cowboys and broncos and Indians,
124860	128120	and like anything Texas was up my alley.
128120	131900	And he met me, and he's like, why, what's all the Texas stuff, you know?
131900	134280	He's like, well, you know, my dad lives in Texas.
134900	136540	Well, he ain't here, is he?
136540	138280	I'm like, no.
138280	141580	He's like, well, I think I'd get over the Texas thing if I were you.
141580	144440	I'd be like, you know, that really hurt my feelings.
144440	149400	And he proceeded to like latch into this thing, like, so what, are you mama's boy?
149740	150620	Cowboys lost today.
150920	151980	Did your dad call?
152580	153360	No, right?
153360	156160	I mean, he's a very tough guy, very tough guy.
157160	164660	And through a little bit of what my mother felt was kind of abusive behavior,
165660	170000	I grew to love him, right?
170000	172100	I mean, I hated him, but I loved him.
172100	175400	I thought about him all the time and what he would think about something.
175400	181580	And like, for example, he decided that since I was so into football,
181940	184340	but you don't know how to play football, you know?
184620	187140	What, did your dad teach you to play football?
187280	188560	No, I don't think he did, did he?
188560	190360	All right, come on, let's play football.
190600	192140	No, I'm not looking for the pity thing.
192140	193120	It was really pretty funny.
193120	194520	I mean, he was a funny guy.
194520	197260	He was trying to help me in his own weird way.
197260	203620	So he takes me outside, he takes me outside, and he says, all right,
203620	206060	I'm going to teach you how to play football, all right?
206160	209840	But football is a man's game, it's not a mama's boy's game, all right?
210600	214220	You make a diamond with your hands, your thumb to your four fingers,
214820	217320	and if you can touch it, you can catch it, all right?
217320	218080	So I'm like, all right.
219080	225740	Bam! You know, and I was, and he's like, you still with me?
225740	226740	You still want to play football?
226740	229420	Huh? I'm like, yeah, I want to play football.
229420	232180	He's like, all right, if you can touch it, you can catch it, all right?
233060	235140	Bam! You know, and it just went on.
235200	243180	I mean, and it was freezing outside, and my nose is bleeding, and I'm crying,
243180	248600	and I want to go inside, and he's like, you know, you've got to catch this football, right?
248600	250640	And so finally, I catch it, like, three times.
250640	253060	He's like, all right, see, you're not such a little mama's boy, after all,
253380	254700	and I feel kind of good about myself.
254900	257600	I mean, you know, I don't want to have me go figure, you know?
257980	264880	So my mom really liked him, and we moved to Vermont, and he took us,
264880	269780	and he moved us into this one bedroom, one, not, it was just a one room cabin in Vermont,
269780	277220	whereas he had this gig as a ski instructor, and it was really picturesque,
277220	281980	and he really had it in his heart, like, to teach me how to be a man, you know?
281980	287700	And we would, he taught me how to chop wood, and he bought me a jeans jacket,
287700	292820	and he would have my mom do, like, patches on the back, you know, and it was really very cool,
292820	294040	and I started to feel very cool.
294040	303040	He took me to see The Man Who Would Be King, and, you know, I cried at the end,
303040	306640	which is, this is a digression, I'm going to regret doing this, but it's my favorite line,
306640	310000	since I have an audience, I have to tell you, it's like, Sean Connery is standing
310000	314840	on the burning bridge, and Michael Caine shouts, he's, the bridge is burning, he's going to die,
314840	320360	and Michael Caine scouts out, you know, peachy, will you ever forgive me for being so bleeding,
320360	327360	so stupid, and so bloody arrogant, and Sean Connery says, you know, that I can, and that I do, you know?
327360	331360	And, like, Michael and I sat there, and I just cried, and he was just like,
331360	334360	pull yourself together, man, you know?
334360	340360	We got in the car, a guy's a little M.G., and it's, like, freezing, and I'm crying, and he's like, come on!
340360	348360	It was a good movie, it was sad, but it was, you know, you gotta, you know, I loved it, too, I loved it, too.
348360	352360	But from then on, in my mind, like, Michael and I were, you know,
352360	356360	Michael Caine and Sean Connery on adventures and things, and we had them, you know?
356360	360360	I mean, I had to walk, I mean, it's really kind of picturesque, I had to walk, like, two miles to school,
360360	366360	and I was only in second grade, and it was very fun, he insisted that I do it, you know, by myself,
366360	371360	and my mother had a lot of problems with him, like, the, the, like, when my mother would go,
371360	374360	she had to go to town a couple times, and he would take me on dates with other women,
374360	378360	and, like, if you tell your mother, I'm gonna kick your ass, and I thought it was great.
378360	383360	I mean, again, like, you keep being judgmental, and I was like, I was like, this guy is so cool.
383360	388360	And I remember I, like, rolled joints for him for this other girl.
388360	395360	I don't know, I have this vague memory of it, but, and finally, like, my most pivotal memory of him,
395360	401360	aside from the closing of my story, is, is we had, you know, this little one-room cabin,
401360	406360	I mean, it was really, really idyllic, snow, and Vermont, and all this other stuff,
406360	410360	and, and Michael, we're out on this little deck outside of it, and Michael's like,
410360	415360	see that, look at that buck, look at that buck, look at that, get the shotgun, Ethan, get the shotgun,
415360	421360	you know, and I'm like, I'm like, what for? He's like, we're gonna kill it, you know,
421360	427360	and I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, Mom, Michael's gonna kill a buck, Michael's gonna kill a buck!
427360	434360	And Michael goes, you, I was gonna let you shoot it.
434360	437360	You blew it, you know, and I didn't know how I felt, because I didn't want to shoot it,
437360	442360	but now I felt like I should have wanted to shoot it, and like, I don't know, I felt very strange.
442360	447360	Doesn't exactly make sense, but you can understand the subconscious, very influenced.
447360	452360	And so, finally one day, I come walking home from school, this little cabin,
452360	457360	and all my mother's underwear and lingerie, kind of like things,
457360	464360	are nailed to the outside of the house, right? This is a true story, all right?
464360	472360	And I'm like, wow, that's weird, you know? And, and, and, and inside there's like,
472360	475360	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
475360	480360	And, you know, we basically get in a car and we're gone.
480360	483360	And we move to Atlanta, Georgia.
483360	488360	And, you know, I don't know any more about what happened there than you do.
488360	494360	I mean, long charade, I can guess, you know, but I've never asked my mom,
494360	499360	my mom has a lot of issues, but that's not, this is Michael's ode.
499360	503360	And so anyway, we move to Atlanta, Georgia, and what happens is,
503360	510360	my father gets remarried, and for some reason, to my now eight-year-old mind,
510360	513360	this is very disturbing.
513360	516360	I'm not invited to the wedding, and I'm very upset about this,
516360	523360	and it's kind of throwing my whole Texas fantasy scheme apart.
523360	528360	And I get, but I'm in this like weird school in Atlanta, Georgia,
528360	533360	and I actually get accepted to this little gifted and talented program,
533360	534360	like for an eight-year-old, right?
534360	538360	And I go to, and I get kicked out on the second day
538360	542360	because I told some kid that his painting sucked, right?
542360	544360	Or the teacher, I didn't get kicked out right away.
544360	550360	I had to write a one-page essay about why I would, you know,
550360	555360	I was supposed to write about why saying somebody's painting sucked was a bad thing.
555360	559360	And I wrote in my essay that I didn't know that it was something bad
559360	562360	because my mother goes out with lots of guys,
562360	566360	and the last one that she dated told me I sucked all the time,
566360	568360	and I didn't think it was that big a deal.
568360	572360	Now, that sounds like, the truth is, I knew exactly what I was doing.
572360	577360	Like, it wasn't like I was trying to make my mom look bad in front of the teachers
577360	581360	to like deflect, you know, me being in trouble.
581360	583360	My mom was so angry at me.
583360	585360	She got this call from the teacher, and she hangs up,
585360	588360	you little shit, you know?
588360	592360	Well, I don't date lots of guys, and Michael didn't say you sucked.
592360	593360	Yes, he did. All right, he did.
593360	595360	But, you know, like, blah, blah, blah.
595360	598360	And anyway, the point is, and then I got in a fight,
598360	600360	and I got kicked out of this gifted and talented thing,
600360	603360	and it was like a big deal, and my father's getting remarried,
603360	605360	and they send me to a child psychologist,
605360	611360	and my mom comes up with this idea that she's going to invite Michael to come to my birthday,
611360	614360	like that I could really use this, right?
614360	616360	But I don't know about this, but so my birthday arrives,
616360	619360	and we're living in Atlanta, Georgia now,
619360	623360	and who comes down the street in a little MG with the golden retriever
623360	626360	right in the side of the thing, and his hair and his beard,
626360	629360	and he's got this, you know, thing and a bunch of presents in the back,
629360	634360	comes pulling up, and it was really one of the greatest moments in my life.
634360	636360	I mean, I was so happy to see him,
636360	640360	and I had all these boys come over for my birthday party,
640360	643360	and Michael took turns taking us around the block,
643360	646360	and he would like peel out fishtail around the thing,
646360	647360	and my mother would be screaming,
647360	649360	Michael, get him in, and all the boys would be like,
649360	652360	your dad is so cool.
652360	656360	And I'd be like, I know, I know, he's so cool.
656360	658360	And it was really one of those glorious days.
658360	660360	Michael took us all to Chuck E. Cheese's,
660360	663360	and we went to see George Burns in Oh God,
663360	668360	and everybody was just so into Michael,
668360	672360	and I, by association, was a very studly guy.
672360	678360	And so then it's the night's over, and Michael's going to leave.
678360	681360	You know, Michael says goodbye, and I say, all right, see you later,
681360	685360	and he starts to go, and I go to my room, and I start sobbing, right?
685360	690360	And so my mother comes in, and it's like, what are you crying about?
690360	693360	It's like nothing, nothing, you know, I just,
693360	695360	I wish Michael was going to stay longer, you know,
695360	697360	and she's like, all right,
697360	703360	and she goes outside, and okay, but yeah, go, go, go.
703360	709360	And it's very good, very good timing, very good timing.
709360	713360	Like Pat Riley would say, it's all good.
713360	716360	So much for him.
716360	723360	But so Michael comes into my room, and I'm devastated,
723360	725360	because as much as I would like,
725360	727360	and everything for him to talk to me and everything,
727360	730360	I am so upset, you know,
730360	735360	and I really don't want him to see me like this, you know?
735360	741360	And he tells me that, you know, he's going to stay in touch with me,
741360	744360	and that don't worry, you know, my mom's a pain in the ass,
744360	748360	we all know that, but I'm going to stay in touch with you,
748360	751360	you're a great kid, you know, and he might have even told me he loved me.
751360	753360	I mean, he was really being really nice.
753360	756360	And he drove from Vermont to Georgia for a day.
756360	764360	And so, and then he leaves, and you know, like I watch him drive away,
764360	768360	it's like night now, and I watch the MG and the golden retriever like take off,
768360	771360	and my mom comes back in the house and I hear it,
771360	776360	and I just scream out the room like, I am never going to speak to you again.
776360	780360	You know, I felt so betrayed by her, because if Michael was going to leave,
780360	783360	I wanted him to think I didn't care, you know?
783360	787360	And he, and I never saw him again, you know?
787360	792360	And I got a message, my mother got a message about two or three years ago,
792360	796360	something that she Googled Michael Marquis.
796360	801360	No, she didn't, that she had heard from him,
801360	805360	and that like he saw some movie I did and thought that I was doing really great.
805360	810360	It really meant a lot to me because, you know, nobody I know knows him,
810360	812360	but I carry him with me every day.
812360	816360	And he's been the secret influence of my life.
816360	818360	Thank you.

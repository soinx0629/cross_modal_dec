1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,120
Where I grew up in the South, there was a right way to do things and a wrong way to

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,400
do things.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,440
And the right way was to do what your family and society thought you should do.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,560
And the wrong way was to do something different.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,000
By age 30, I'd done most everything I was supposed to do.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,120
I'd overachieved in high school.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,720
I attended a prestigious college in the South.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,960
I had a good job, and I'd married well within the childbearing age.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,880
We'd married at my insistence, of course, but neither one of us was fully on board.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,320
So except for moving up north to Boston, which caused my family to collectively take to their

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,840
beds, I was on track with what we thought my life should look like, but I wasn't happy,

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,600
and I thought it was my career.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,880
In my family, I was expected to go into business.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,640
I'd been in public relations for seven years, but I didn't like the work anymore.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,160
I mean, I was good at it, but I was tired of working with clients, and plus I was working

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:12,480
with companies like retail banking, traffic reporting, hazardous waste recycling, nothing

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,680
that really blew my skirt up.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,560
So I quit my full-time job, and I started consulting, and I started taking classes to

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,200
figure out what else I could do for a living.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,080
Now, the only criterion for the classes was that the instructors and students could not

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,480
know or care what the Financial Times was.

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,600
I took needlepoint, directing, French.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,920
I found this brochure for the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and I thought,

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,120
oh, well, this looks interesting.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,760
And I went to the school, and I talked to the continuing education director, and I asked

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,960
him which class he thought I should take, and he said, you need to take art as process.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,720
We take burnout executives in that class all the time.

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,040
I sign up.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
It's my first day of art school.

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,080
I do my best to look artsy, to fit in, but even though I am not wearing pearls, they

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,160
are still emblazoned on my chest.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,320
And our instructor, Rhoda, introduces herself, and she says, there is no right way to make

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,040
art, and there is no wrong way to make art.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,160
Now this makes me extremely nervous, because I have been raised that there is a right way

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,200
and a wrong way to do most everything.

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,840
And then she says, the class will focus on process, the process of art making, not the

37
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,920
end result.

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,640
Now this makes me even more nervous, because I have been raised to focus on results, and

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,880
not just any results, but the best results.

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,040
And there are no grades.

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Things careen out of control.

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,280
If there are no grades, how will I know if I'm overachieving?

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,840
I need to know that I'm overachieving.

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,720
We start with the basics, and in my entire life, I have never held a stick of charcoal

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,200
in my hand, and it feels good.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,920
And I survive the first week of simple art exercises, and I enjoy myself.

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,640
And the next week, Bob, one of the three instructors, says, today we're going to do gesture drawings,

48
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,320
very fast drawings, about 45 second poses, and we're going to draw the energy and the

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,280
movement and the essence of the figure.

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,240
And I am thinking, what the heck is essence, and how the heck do you draw it?

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,960
And a man, the artist's model, starts to undress.

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,200
And I say, well that's okay, you've seen a naked man before, you've even had sex with

53
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,560
a naked man before.

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:56,400
Your problem is, you don't know how to draw this naked man's essence.

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,360
And everybody else apparently does know how to draw his essence, as they're all busily

56
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,400
getting out their easels and knowingly getting out sheets of paper and charcoal and other

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,360
drawing mediums with which they excel.

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,720
And I'm just standing there like the proverbial deer in headlights, and I begin to watch and

59
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,840
imitate because I am clueless but competitive.

60
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,080
And so I ask Judy, who is standing next to me and also a mature student, I say, Judy,

61
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,920
what are these supposed to look like?

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,960
Because of course I think there's only one right way to do this, and we're all going

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,880
to draw the same image.

64
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,640
And she looks at me bewildered and says, they're all going to look different.

65
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,120
I'm paralyzed.

66
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,480
What is mine supposed to look like?

67
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,560
Can't I just do a slide presentation for your board of directors, maybe conduct a communications

68
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,080
audit, assess your customer service capabilities?

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,640
These are things I know how to do, things in which I excel, and I like to excel, and

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,920
there is no way I'm going to excel drawing this naked man's essence.

71
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,480
And I'm about to cry, and then the competitive side of me kicks in and says, well just snap

72
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,760
out of it, you big wimp, and do something.

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,320
So I start making these hopeless stick figures every 45 seconds, because that's how fast

74
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,960
the poses are every 45 seconds, and every 45 seconds I feel like a total failure, which

75
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:29,000
is a lot of times in one hour, it's 80.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,920
And the shame is enormous, and I'm mortified at how inept I am, and I'm beating myself

77
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,760
up for ever trying anything different, for even attempting anything new, and I'm in literal

78
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,040
physical pain, I am so far out of my comfort level, I mean I actually hurt.

79
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,360
And I'm about to cry again, and that's when Bob comes over and shows me what amazing teachers

80
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,080
can do, I don't even know what he says, all I know is he talks me off the ledge and breaks

81
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,640
the vice grip that has a hold of me, and I start to draw.

82
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,560
At the end of class, Bob picks one of my gesture drawings to put up on the wall with a bunch

83
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,080
of other student drawings so we can discuss them.

84
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,400
No one laughs at me or my drawing, it actually holds its own.

85
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:24,440
I have drawn a naked man, and I feel like I can do anything, but things at home start

86
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,960
to get a little tricky.

87
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,760
My husband is an art director, one of the reasons why I married him, I loved being with

88
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,960
somebody artsy, he seemed so exotic and interesting.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He was the creative one, and I was the business one.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,480
But when I started going to art school, all the roles were off, the balance of power completely

91
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,740
out of sync.

92
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,440
So class continues for the next six weeks, and it's an emotional rollercoaster, I mean

93
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,840
my thinking is shifting and breaking apart and I cry every day.

94
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,560
And my final assignment is a wall installation, which is a term I didn't even know existed

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,480
six weeks before.

96
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,320
And it includes these three wall sculptures, these sculptures made out of the New York

97
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,760
Times business sections and the Wall Street Journal, all painted black.

98
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,840
And they're bound in these really tight boxes.

99
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,560
And each piece gets progressively more undone until the final piece explodes.

100
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,640
And Bob, the instructor that talked to me off the ledge, sees it, and he says, Trisha,

101
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,720
you know, you really ought to apply to the museum school.

102
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,840
Well, this thought had never occurred to me before, I mean, in the back of my mind, I'm

103
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,800
going to end up in business school, that this is a once in a lifetime event until I go back

104
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,800
to my normal life, and I'm highly suspicious, and then it occurs to me what's happening.

105
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,600
He's hitting on me.

106
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,040
I have no artistic talent at all.

107
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,320
He's just flattering me until he can get lucky.

108
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,720
And this theory sticks until I find out he's been in a committed relationship for the past

109
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,520
18 years with his boyfriend.

110
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,560
So then I start thinking of other reasons why they may want me to apply.

111
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,620
Maybe they think I have a lot of money and I'll be a big donor, because I was working

112
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,560
at Harvard Business School at the time, or maybe they think I know people who will be

113
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,860
big donors.

114
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,640
And so while I'm using all of my creative energy trying to imagine why I'm not creative,

115
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,040
Charles, one of the instructors, comes up to me and says, Trisha, you really ought to

116
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,760
apply to the museum school.

117
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,600
I mean, you know you're an artist.

118
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,800
You're one of us.

119
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,480
Panic begins to set in.

120
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,080
And I enroll in art school as a part-time student, but I'm still consulting.

121
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,680
And I'm both excited and traumatized, because for the first time in my life, I am not following

122
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
the rules.

123
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:59,200
And I say to my dear friend Sarah, who's also a Southerner, I say, Sarah, I am so afraid

124
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,520
of being different than everybody else.

125
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:09,200
And she says, oh, Trisha, I'm so afraid of being just like everybody else.

126
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,320
And my marriage begins to explode.

127
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,720
And part of the reason is I'm not supposed to excel beyond men, definitely not beyond

128
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
my husband.

129
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,480
I had places I wanted to go, and he just wasn't moving fast enough.

130
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,000
I kept pushing him to move faster so I could move forward.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And one day, he just says to me, Trisha, you just want me to go places I don't want to

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,760
go.

133
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,760
At art school, since we don't have grades, we have review boards.

134
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,700
And at the end of each semester, we put up all the work we've done, and two instructors

135
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,540
and several students review the work, give us feedback, and guide us on our creative

136
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,780
path.

137
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,100
And I'm driving to my review board in the Jeep I've purchased for the yet-to-be-conceived

138
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,620
children I assume I'll have.

139
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,780
But instead, it's piled high with artwork.

140
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:06,940
And at my review board, one of the students writes this on his review board sheet.

141
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,220
You seem to be a little frantic.

142
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
Very perceptive.

143
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,020
It has something to do with control.

144
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,220
It's okay to let go.

145
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,980
You're expecting this to be black or white, but the process won't allow that.

146
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,100
You've got to let go.

147
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,380
I'm not sure if he's talking about my artwork or my marriage.

148
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,060
My husband and I separate, and a dear friend of mine says, you know, Trisha, I love my

149
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,700
husband and I love my children, but I never thought I had options.

150
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,780
You have options.

151
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,580
And she's right, because even though my life is blowing apart, or maybe because it is,

152
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,920
I begin to really find my voice and step into my artwork.

153
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,140
My mother sees it and says, why is it so dark?

154
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:04,860
Why aren't there any heads?

155
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,380
It's getting harder and harder to do my consulting work, and even though I'm getting paid a firehose

156
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,260
of cash, I know that if I do this work for much longer, I'm going to die.

157
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,060
Slowly, but I'm going to die.

158
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,060
And I realize I'm not just in the wrong job or the wrong marriage.

159
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,260
I'm in the wrong life.

160
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,020
I don't want to do what other people want me to do or think I should do anymore.

161
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,060
All I want is to make art.

162
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,460
I'm an artist.

163
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:42,900
And the week we separate, they tear down my family home of 25 years and my Jeep gets stolen.

164
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,580
I have this keychain with three keys on it, one to the house I don't live in anymore,

165
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,420
one to my family home that's been torn down, and one to my Jeep that's been stolen.

166
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,500
God is banging on my hood.

167
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,060
So I toss the keys, head to art school, and join my tribe.

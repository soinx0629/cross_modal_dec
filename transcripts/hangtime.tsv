0	5200	I've always been an adrenaline junkie.
5200	7360	I love driving fast in my car.
7360	13880	I love zipping through the woods on my snowboard, my skis, and I really love backflipping my
13880	16040	BMX bike.
16040	19480	What I haven't really experienced was flight.
19480	25240	It was something that I'd always been interested in, but hadn't had a lot of experience with,
25240	28320	and specifically helicopter flight.
28320	34960	I always thought that was the most awesome craft to pilot, being quick and light and
34960	41520	nimble, and when I saw an ad in the Westward paper announcing an introductory offer for
41520	47320	30 minutes of sightseeing and 30 minutes of instructional time, I felt like it was speaking
47320	50280	directly to me.
50280	55120	So I called them up immediately and set my appointment, and for the next few days I
55160	58920	was extremely excited for that day.
58920	62000	So when the day came, I got to the office early.
62000	67920	I'm never early, for anything, but I was early on this day, and I'm walking into the office
67920	73280	and I look over and I see a motorcycle in the shadows, this really cool looking motorcycle,
73280	77480	and I remember thinking, these are my people.
77480	84400	So I go in, I sign my name, I go out with the pilot, we look at the helicopter, we get
84480	89960	inside, butterflies are going, I am so pumped, it's time, I'm going to fly this thing.
89960	95160	I got my own set of controls, he has his own set of controls, we get our little lap belts
95160	102160	on, get our headsets on, and then the pilot points over at this fire extinguisher and
102160	108400	he says, I need you to promise me something, and I'm going to promise you something too.
108400	115400	If you are on fire, I promise I will put you out.
117400	123400	So I say back to him, if you are on fire, I promise I will put you out.
123400	129880	He gives me a high five, we start it up, the main rotor blade starts spinning and we just
129880	135220	lift off the ground, he just takes us right up and it's got a glass floor, I'm looking
135220	140620	at it and it's like jumping my bike but never coming down, we just continue to go up and
140620	146980	up and I am so stoked, we're flying around and you wouldn't believe, just out past the
146980	153740	dirt roads, it is like an African savanna, a safari, you just see things that you would
153740	157660	never see or realize are just out there past the city.
157660	163020	We get up and I see this herd of deer and it's so beautiful, they're like running because
163020	166900	they hear the helicopter and they're in a big pack and they're looking over their shoulders
166900	172100	and we're flying above them and I'm just like how cool is this, nobody would ever get to
172100	178140	see this and so then he zips into this little, this empty river bed and then just starts
178140	183380	gunning it through this river bed like 15, 20 feet above the ground and I'm loving it,
183380	187900	there's trees on either side of us and we're just zipping, winding through it and I'm just
188380	193340	like this is so cool, I say to him, dude you need to get an awesome stereo system in this
193340	200380	thing man, you can just rock out and he looks over at me like yeah, yeah, this is good right
200380	204580	and I'm just envisioning this, I'm having this whole fantasy in my head, I'm like I'm
204580	208460	going to get one of these someday, I'm going to have my own helicopter, I'm going to tint
208460	213040	the windows, I'm going to paint it like a dragonfly, I'm going to put a sweet stereo
213040	216060	system in this thing, people are going to be looking up in the air like hey there's
216220	221820	Brian, look at him, so I'm just in this fantasy world, just so stoked, we're just hauling
221820	227340	ass around, I love it and then he comes up out of there and he says alright, play time's
227340	231700	over, business time, time for you to learn a little bit, anybody that's going to be a
231700	237580	real pilot needs to know this, it's an emergency drill, it's an auto rotation, basically I'm
237580	242940	going to cut the power, it's like putting your car into neutral going downhill, main
242940	246500	rotor blade's going to keep spinning but there's going to be a big drop in altitude
246500	251540	at the beginning, you like Elitch's rides and you know, roller coasters, that kind of
251540	256460	stuff, you got a soft stomach or are you pretty tough, I'm like I'm good with that, I'm cool,
256460	261020	he's okay, okay cool, because if you have a problem just let me know, I'll land and
261020	269460	you can hurl, okay cool, bases are covered, let's do this, so sure enough, he kills the
269460	276140	power, woo, we get that like 30 foot drop just instantly in altitude, I feel the upward
276140	282140	draft of the air and we just kind of come into like this soft, slow drift and I'm getting
282140	287860	to feel what he's saying you can do if you have an emergency landing situation and then
287860	291340	I start looking at him, he's fidgeting with stuff, he's turning things, he's got a stressed
291340	296620	look on his face, I'm just like, everything alright, he looks at me with wild eyes, it's
296620	305700	like this is the real thing man, I can't believe it, I look out, I look down, it's
305700	312340	like a model railroad set, these tiny little trees and my first thought is we're going
312340	322820	to die, we are going to die, I signed up for this, I paid money to die, like you've got
323820	329140	to be kidding me, and I'm just watching and we're slowly starting to fall towards the
329140	335820	earth and I cannot believe this is happening, I'm just like this is a bad joke right, like
335820	339940	when's the camera's going to come out and he's going to smile and say, just kidding,
339940	349220	but he doesn't, he's just doing like S turns and figure eights and I'm just thinking, I
349220	354420	never expected that this would be my last day and I start having these crazy thoughts
354420	361100	like I put in some pictures to get developed, who's going to ever see those, who's going
361100	368860	to get my car, like it's parked down there and I'm just like, I can't believe that this
368860	373500	is the day, we're going to die, there's just no other way around it, you don't walk away
374380	380780	crash and so he starts looking like he may be able to land this thing, we're coming down
380780	388020	towards the ground and now my mind starts to shift from we're going to die to we're
388020	394340	going to get really worked, we're going to hit the ground and it's going to suck, I'm
394340	400780	going to be laying there with a broken back, it's just like I wear more pads when I'm riding
400780	405620	my bike, I've got a helmet and knee pads and I've got a little lap belt and this little
405620	411140	headset and we're in like a glass box, I'm just like, we're definitely going to get worked,
411140	418100	so admit it to yourself, the next hour is going to really suck, you know, and so here
418100	422700	we go, we're coming in for a landing, we're coming in about a 10, 12 degree angle, he's
422700	426900	doing good, he's got us going about 50 miles an hour straight towards the ground and he
426900	431780	just yells to me, he's like, we're going to hit and I just did the only thing I thought
431780	436780	seemed right, I just shut my eyes, I took a deep breath, I put my arms out in front
436780	443060	of my face and sure enough, we hit the ground and we just four by four across the prairie,
443060	450500	just like, you know, bouncing across the gopher holes and then the left skid digs into the
450500	456260	ground and it makes us stop instantly and we just jerk forward and then the main rotor
456260	462420	blade is just going super fast, it hits the ground and it just cartwheels the whole helicopter
462420	468220	and it smashes and breaks it right off behind our heads and we come to a stop looking at
468220	475060	the sky and there's just smoke and I can smell jet fuel and the flight manuals are all scattered
475060	481020	around inside the cockpit and I just shoulder the door and jump out and my feet touch the
481020	487100	ground and I just can't believe it, I'm just like, yes! And I look up and I'm just like,
487100	492660	oh my god, we were just up that high and now we're here and I have just like a tiny cut
492660	500540	on my pinky and I'm just astounded that this has just happened and then I look at the pilot
500540	506300	and he comes around the corner from his side and he's just like, I am so sorry, dude, I
506300	514860	am so sorry and I'm just like, thank you, you did it, you landed it and he's like, I'm so sorry,
514860	522780	Brian and I'm like, thank you and it goes on and on like this and I'm just, I'm beside myself,
522780	528260	I cannot believe it, I'm like, I'm fine and then he just, he turns into a stress case,
528260	533740	his hands are, his head's in his hands, he's just like, oh my god, I am so dead,
534700	540900	he's gonna have to make a full investigation, there's a $9,000 deductible, we just rebuilt
540900	547780	the thing, we gotta go find help, let's go, so off we go, we just go walking across the
547780	556740	prairie and I'm just like, a pie in the sky, just like, oh wow, this is crazy, wait till I tell my
556740	567300	friends about this one and he's stressed the whole walk and then we see a truck come rumbling down
567300	574620	the dirt road, we're like, hey, we wave down this truck, we hop over the fence, we flag these guys
574620	581140	down, they've got a CB in their truck, they call the paramedics, the cops, literally within minutes,
581460	588220	it's like every single emergency vehicle within a tri-state region is coming over the hill,
588220	593820	ambulances, fire trucks, cops, four-wheelers, everybody wants to see what's going on, a
593820	601940	helicopter crash and people lived, what? So it's crazy, you know, the paramedics insist that I'm
601940	607300	in shock and I'm injured, I had to have gotten hurt, I'm just not feeling it yet, even though
607300	612780	I've walked miles to get here, I'm like, I'm fine, I crash on a regular basis on my bike,
612780	618540	I'm good, I know when I'm hurt, but they insist on taking me to the hospital and checking me out
618540	624540	and giving me an IV of saline and so I'm laying there and I get interviewed by the news and my
624540	632260	phone is blowing up and it's just an insane day and I can't believe it, I'm like, it's a dream,
633140	640260	I just go home and I'm just like, what? And I'm laying in bed that night and I just, I'm laying
640260	648340	on my back, my head's on my pillow and I shut my eyes and I still feel like I'm falling, I still
648340	655780	feel like I'm slowly drifting to the earth and I'm like, you know, I think I'm gonna still live
655780	661660	boldly, I'm gonna still go fast in my car, I'm gonna still jump my bike and do crazy stuff,
661660	668060	but I don't think I need to learn how to fly a helicopter. Thank you.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,260
So, I'm not depressed now, but I was depressed for a long time and I wrote about being depressed

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:23,460
and I lived for a long time with blinding depression and had long stretches when everything

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,520
seemed hopeless and pointless, when returning calls from friends seemed like more than I

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:36,200
could do, when getting up and going out into the world seemed painful, when I was completely

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,720
crippled with anxiety and when I finally got better and started writing about the process

6
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,760
of recovery, I became very interested in all of the different kinds of treatment that there

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,060
were for depression and having started as a kind of medical conservative thinking that

8
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,240
there were only a couple of things that worked, medication and certain talking therapies

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,160
and that that was really it, I very gradually began to change my mind because I realized

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,480
that if you have brain cancer and you decide that standing on your head and gargling for

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,960
half an hour every day makes you feel better, it may make you feel better, but the likelihood

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,360
is that you still have brain cancer and you're still going to die from it.

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,200
But if you have depression and you say that standing on your head and gargling for half

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,320
an hour makes you feel better, then you are actually cured because depression is an illness

15
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,960
of how you feel and if you feel really great after you do that, then you're not depressed

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
anymore.

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,200
So I began to think all kinds of things could work and I researched everything ranging from

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,640
experimental brain surgeries to hypnotic regimens of various kinds, I had people writing to

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,840
me because I had been publishing on this subject, there was one woman who wrote to me and she

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,160
said that she had tried actually electroshock treatments and a variety of other approaches

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,720
to depression, medication and therapy and she had finally found the thing that worked

22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,520
for her and she wanted me to tell the world about it and that was making little things

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:17,000
from yarn, some of which she sent me and none of which I'm wearing right now, but in any

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,680
event I had that rich engagement and I also became interested as I was doing this work

25
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,360
in the idea that depression existed not only in the civilized west as people tended to

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:37,200
perceive it to exist but actually across cultures and had existed across time and so when one

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,240
of my dearest friends, my friend David Hecht who was living for a little while in Senegal

28
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,880
said to me, do you know about the tribal rituals that are used for the treatment of depression

29
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
here?

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,480
I said no, I don't know about them but I would like to know about them and he said well if

31
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,560
you come for a visit we could try to do some research on this topic and so I set off for

32
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:07,680
Senegal and I met David and I was introduced to David's then girlfriend, now ex-wife Ellen

33
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,240
and it turned out that Ellen had a cousin whose mother was a friend of someone who went

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,040
to school with the daughter of a person who actually practiced the ndop and that I could

35
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,880
therefore go and interview this woman who had practiced the ndop and so we went off

36
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:35,160
to a small town about two hours outside of Dakar and I was introduced to this extraordinary

37
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:43,920
old large woman wrapped in miles and miles of African fabric printed with figures of

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,120
eyes and she was Madame D'Youff and we did an interview for about an hour and she told

39
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,040
me all about the ndop and at the end of it feeling rather daring I said, listen I said

40
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,920
I hope, I don't know whether this is something you would even consider I said but would it

41
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:07,480
be possible for me to attend an ndop and she said well I've certainly never had a foreigner the

42
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,640
local word was to Bob I've never had a foreigner attend one of these before she said but actually

43
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,640
she said I mean you've come through these friends and these connections she said yes the next time

44
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,280
I perform an ndop you may be present and I said that's fantastic I said when are you next going

45
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:31,920
to be doing an ndop and she said oh it'll be sometime in the next six months and I said six

46
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,480
months is quite a long time for me to stay here in this town waiting for you to do one I said is

47
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,480
there anyone who might maybe we could expedite one for somebody move it forward I'll pitch in

48
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:53,080
she said no it really doesn't work that way she said I'm sorry but that's that's how it is and

49
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,360
I said well I guess I won't be able to see an ndop then but even so this conversation has been

50
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:06,040
so interesting and so helpful to me and and I I'm a little sad leaving here about not actually

51
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,120
getting to see one but but I thank you and she's well I'm glad that you could come I'm glad it was

52
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,240
helpful and she said but there is one other thing she said I I hope you don't mind my saying this

53
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:25,480
and I said no what what is it and she said you don't look that great yourself she said are you

54
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:32,240
you are suffering from depression and I said well yes I said I was very acute it's kind of a little

55
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,960
better now but yeah I still do actually suffer from depression she said well I've certainly

56
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:47,680
never done this for a tuba before but I could actually do an ndop for you and I said oh I said

57
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,960
what an what an interesting idea I said well um yes sure yeah absolutely yes let's let's let's do

58
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,080
that I said that I'll have an ndop and she said oh well that's great she said and she gave us some

59
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,360
sort of fairly basic instructions and then we left and my translator the aforementioned then

60
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,600
girlfriend now ex-wife of my friend turned to me and she said are you completely crazy do you have

61
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,480
any idea what you're getting yourself into and I said well you know I'm all these things very

62
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,480
interesting she said you're crazy she said you're totally crazy but I'll help you if you want so we

63
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,120
had left and the first thing we had was a shopping list there had been a she had you could get them

64
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,720
to buy the stuff but you had to pay a surcharge I'd said no we'd buy the stuff so we had to go

65
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:46,240
out we had to buy seven yards of African fabric we had to get a calabash which was a large bowl

66
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,880
fashioned from a gourd we had to get three kilos of millet we had to get sugar we had to get cola

67
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:02,920
beans and then we had to get two live cockerels two roosters and a ram and so Ellen and I went

68
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,640
to the market with David and with these other people and we got most of the things and I said

69
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,000
well but what what about the the ram and Ellen said we can't buy the ram today what are we gonna

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,840
do with it overnight so I saw the sense of that so the next day the next day we got into a taxi

71
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,000
to go back out two hours to where we were going and I said what about the ram and Ellen said oh

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,120
we'll see a ram along the way so we were going along and going along and there was a Senegalese

73
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,880
shepherd by the side of the road with his flock and we stopped the cab and we got out and we

74
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,960
bought the ram for seven dollars and then we had a little bit of a struggle getting the live ram

75
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:57,280
into the trunk of the taxi cab so but the cab driver seemed not at all worried even by the fact

76
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,280
that the ram kept relieving himself in the trunk of the taxi cab and so then we got to Rufi's can

77
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:11,200
we got there so here I am I'm ready for my close-up and the thing about the end up is that it varies

78
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,200
enormously depending on a whole variety of signals and symbols that come from above so we have to go

79
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,960
through this whole shamanistic process and I still didn't know really very much of what was gonna

80
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,200
happen so first I had to change out of my jeans my t-shirt and put on a loincloth and then I sat

81
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:37,520
down and then I had my chest and my arms rubbed with millet and then which is a grain and then

82
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,640
someone said oh we really should have music for this and I said oh great and I thought you know

83
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,720
drumming I thought some atmospheric thing and she came out with her very prized possession which

84
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:55,880
was a battery-operated tape player for which she had one tape which was chariots of fire so we

85
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,920
started listening to chariots of fire and in the meanwhile I was given sort of various shamanistic

86
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,320
objects I had to hold them with my hands and drop them I had to hold them with my feet and drop them

87
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,920
I they would sort of say oh this augurs well this augurs badly there were five assistants to Madame

88
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,960
Diouf who had all gathered around and we sort of spent the morning like this and it was all really

89
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:23,680
just fine and then they said it was maybe we'd started at about 8 maybe about 11 11 30 they said

90
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,880
well now it's actually time for the the central part of the ritual and I said oh okay and the

91
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,200
sound of drumming began the drumming I'd been hoping for the drumming began and so there was

92
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,720
all of this drumming and it was very exciting and we went to the central square of the village

93
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:50,040
where there was a small makeshift wedding bed that I had to get into with the ram and I had been told

94
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,360
it would be very very bad luck if the ram escaped and that I had to hold on to him and that the

95
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,400
reason we had to be in this wedding bed was that all my depression and all my problems were caused

96
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,400
by the fact that I had spirits in Senegal you have spirits that have all over you the way here you

97
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,200
sort of have microbes some are good for you some are bad for you some are neutral anyway my bad

98
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,840
spirits were extremely jealous of my real-life sexual partners some of whom are here tonight and

99
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:26,480
and that we had to mollify the anger of the of the spirit so I had to get into this wedding

100
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,600
bed with the ram and I had to hold the ram very tightly because he he was not having a good life

101
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,800
this ram and he of course immediately relieved himself on my leg and the entire village had

102
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,720
taken the day off from their work in the fields and were dancing around us in concentric circles

103
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,160
and as they danced throwing blankets and sheets of cloth over us and so we were gradually being

104
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,760
buried and it was unbelievably hot and it was completely stifling and there was the sound of

105
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,960
these stamping feet as everyone danced around us and then these drums which were getting louder

106
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,440
and louder and more ecstatic and more ecstatic and I was just about at the point at which I

107
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:11,080
thought I was going to faint or pass out at that key moment suddenly all of the claws were pulled

108
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,640
off I was yanked to my feet the loincloth that was all I was wearing was pulled from me the poor

109
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,520
old Rams throat was slit as were the throats of the two cockerels and I was covered in the blood

110
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:29,680
of the freshly slaughtered ram and the cockerels and so there I was naked totally covered in blood

111
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:42,320
and they said okay that's the end of this part of it and I said well okay and they said but you they

112
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
said we're actually we but there's the next piece comes now and I said okay and we went over back

113
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,040
to the area where we've done the morning preparations and one of them said but look it's it's kind of

114
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,440
lunchtime why don't we just take a break for a minute would you like a coke I don't drink

115
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,760
coke that much but at that moment it seemed like a really really really good idea and I said yes

116
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,560
and so I sat there naked and completely covered in animal blood with flies kind of gathering as

117
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,480
they will when you're naked and covered in animal blood and I drank this coke and then when I had

118
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,360
finished the coke they said okay now we have the sort of final parts of the ritual they said so

119
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,160
first you have to put your your hands by your sides and and hold your stand very straight and

120
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,400
I said okay and then they tied me up with the intestines of the ram and in the meanwhile it

121
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,840
was hanging from a nearby tree and they were there were some instead of doing some butchering of it

122
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,920
and they took various little bits of it out and then I had to kind of shuffle over all tied up in

123
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,640
in intestines which most of you probably haven't done but it's hard I had to shuffle over and I

124
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,320
had to take these little pieces of the ram and I had to dig holes and I had to put the pieces of

125
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,000
the ram in the holes and I had to say something and what I had to say was actually to me incredibly

126
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,720
strangely touching in the middle of this weird experience I had to say spirits leave me alone

127
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,520
to complete the business of my life and know that I will never forget you and I thought what a kind

128
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,800
thing to say to the evil spirits you're exercising that I'll never forget you and I haven't so anyway

129
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,160
there were various other little bits and pieces that followed I was given a piece of paper in

130
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,440
which all of the millet from the morning had been gathered I was told that the next morning I should

131
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,560
sleep with it under my pillow and in the morning get up and give it to a beggar who had good

132
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,760
hearing and no deformities and that when I gave it to him that would be the end of my troubles and

133
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:49,560
then the women sort of all filled their mouths with water and began spitting water all over me

134
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,120
which it turns out is the sort of you know it's the surround shower effect and rinsing the blood

135
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,160
away from me and it gradually came off and when I was clean they gave me back my jeans and everyone

136
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:12,400
danced and they barbecued the ram and we had this dinner and I felt so up I felt so up it had it had

137
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,560
been quite an astonishing experience even though I didn't believe in the animus principles behind

138
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:24,440
it all of these people had been gathered together cheering for me and it was very exhilarating and

139
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,560
I had a very odd experience five years later when I was working on my current book and I was in

140
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Rwanda doing something else altogether and I got into a conversation with someone there and I

141
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,320
described the experience I'd had in Senegal and he said oh you know we have something that's a

142
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,120
little like that he said that's West Africa this is East Africa it's quite different but there are

143
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,600
some similarities in some rituals here he said you know we had a lot of trouble with Western

144
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,680
mental health workers who came here immediately after the genocide and we had to ask some of them

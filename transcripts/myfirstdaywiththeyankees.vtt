00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
I grew up a huge fan of the New York Yankees, which when I was very small,

00:04.960 --> 00:08.960
involved going to games maybe once a year with my father, my little brother,

00:08.960 --> 00:14.280
watching Reggie Jackson, a little bit older, watching Dave Winfield.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.320
And then when I kind of came into my teens,

00:17.320 --> 00:20.920
Don Mattingly, who was, you know, my absolute favorite player.

00:20.920 --> 00:25.680
And as I went to high school in New York and it was kind of a turning point.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.440
The first time that I went to a Yankee game by myself and I started going to

00:28.440 --> 00:33.000
Yankees by myself and it was in one of these games in the fall of 1991 that I

00:33.000 --> 00:37.920
went up to the stadium and bought a ticket to the bleachers and went and sat

00:37.920 --> 00:42.880
in the bleachers and was watching the game and noticed for the first time

00:42.880 --> 00:46.960
something that I'd been to the stadium so many times before, but I'd never seen

00:46.960 --> 00:51.560
this kid in right field wearing a Yankee uniform who was a bad boy playing catch

00:51.560 --> 00:53.120
with the right fielder.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.920
And I'd never noticed the bad boy before.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.640
And this kid could not play catch for his life.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.000
He was throwing the ball over Jesse Barfield's head, the right fielder.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.200
And he was one hopping him.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.360
And I was like, you know, I'm not a great athlete, but I can play catch at least

01:06.360 --> 01:07.760
at least as well as this kid can.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.240
And I don't understand why he has, you know, that job.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.280
And I couldn't.

01:11.280 --> 01:15.680
So I went home that night and I tore a page out of the program that listed all

01:15.680 --> 01:17.440
the different Yankee executives.

01:17.440 --> 01:21.080
And I wrote a handwritten letter to everyone from Steinbrenner on down to

01:21.080 --> 01:24.240
Stunt Merrill, who was the manager at that point, and basically said, you know,

01:24.240 --> 01:28.040
My name is Matt and I'm 16 years old and I'm a huge fan of the Yankees.

01:28.040 --> 01:31.760
And, you know, I don't know if you can apply for this bad boy position, but if

01:31.760 --> 01:33.440
you can, I really would like an application.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.160
And I'm so excited to hear from you that if I don't hear from you soon, I'm

01:36.160 --> 01:37.760
going to follow up with with a phone call.

01:37.760 --> 01:41.960
So I sent these off and about two weeks went by.

01:41.960 --> 01:44.360
And after, you know, two weeks, I hadn't heard anything.

01:44.360 --> 01:48.360
And so I picked up the phone and this Yankee switchboard number was on the

01:48.360 --> 01:49.880
same list of executives.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.400
And secretary asked for the phone.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.280
Hello, New York Yankees.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.920
And I said, hi, this is Matt McGoff.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.600
And I sent a letter in a couple of weeks ago about applying for a bad boy

01:57.600 --> 01:59.760
position and nobody got back to me.

02:00.560 --> 02:04.480
So she is like, okay, well, I'll take your name down and I'll have somebody

02:04.480 --> 02:06.560
get back to you and took my number down.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.640
And another week goes by and I don't hear anything.

02:08.640 --> 02:12.800
So I pick up the phone again and I call on this woman answers the phone.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
Hello, New York Yankees.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.440
And I say, hi, this is Matt.

02:15.440 --> 02:20.040
You know, I sent some letters in about the bad boy position and I called last

02:20.040 --> 02:22.880
week and somebody was supposed to call me back, but, you know, I thought it

02:22.880 --> 02:25.360
was kind of rude that they hadn't.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.280
And so she, you know, she laughed and she asked me, how old were you?

02:29.280 --> 02:30.440
And I said, 16.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.040
She laughed some more and I didn't really understand what she was laughing at.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.640
But, you know, she took down my name again.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.280
She said, you know, I'll, I'll make sure that somebody gets back to you.

02:38.280 --> 02:42.680
So, you know, a few days later, sure enough in the mail, a letter arrived on,

02:42.720 --> 02:46.520
on Yankee letterhead, official letterhead and invited me to come up to the

02:46.520 --> 02:49.520
stadium for an interview with Nick Priory, who's the clubhouse manager.

02:50.160 --> 02:54.200
So I put my jacket and tie on and I don't even think I told any of my friends

02:54.200 --> 02:58.920
about this because it was way, way too weird to explain.

02:58.920 --> 03:03.560
So I went up, took the four train up to the stadium and walked into the, you

03:03.560 --> 03:07.400
know, walked around the stadium and this is October, so they weren't playing in

03:07.400 --> 03:09.720
the world series in October back in 91.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.360
So it was very, very quiet.

03:11.360 --> 03:15.720
And I walked around the stadium and walked into the Yankee lobby and there's

03:15.720 --> 03:19.320
a security guard there and I introduced myself and I say, I'm here for the

03:19.320 --> 03:23.880
batboy interview and he picks up the telephone and he's like, you know, Nick,

03:23.880 --> 03:28.320
some kids here to see you and, you know, okay, so he says, you know, have a seat.

03:28.320 --> 03:32.560
So I sit down in the pinstripe lobby and I'm, you know, passing about 10 minutes

03:32.560 --> 03:36.080
waiting for this guy, Nick, to come up for the first job interview of my life,

03:36.080 --> 03:37.200
for the first job of my life.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.400
And I'm, you know, trying to think of the questions that he might ask me.

03:40.400 --> 03:44.400
And so I'm ready to tell him what my favorite subject is in school and tell

03:44.400 --> 03:48.160
him, you know, why I think the Yankees need a big bat behind Mattingly, you

03:48.200 --> 03:52.000
know, to win the pennant next year and what, you know, Mickey Mantle's batting

03:52.000 --> 03:55.880
average was in 1956 and like all these different questions.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.480
So, you know, I'm kind of passing the time and these double doors burst open and

03:59.480 --> 04:03.480
this guy walks in, obviously, Nick, but he doesn't introduce himself.

04:03.480 --> 04:08.240
He's, you know, could be anywhere from 40 to 80 years of age.

04:08.240 --> 04:13.400
He has this greased back hair and he has a stogie between the two teeth left in

04:13.400 --> 04:18.280
his mouth and a chaw of tobacco possibly also and this wife beater t-shirt and

04:18.280 --> 04:22.600
Yankee shorts and white athletic socks pulled up to his knees and he has shoe

04:22.600 --> 04:26.080
polish, like black sneakers that are obviously shoe polished.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.640
And he just looks at me and says, are your parents going to mind you taking the

04:29.640 --> 04:31.680
train home late at night?

04:31.680 --> 04:34.480
So I say, you know, I take the train to school every day.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.640
I think, I think it'll be fine.

04:35.640 --> 04:39.480
And he just kind of looks at me and finally I say, no, I don't think my parents

04:39.480 --> 04:41.080
will mind me taking the train home late at night.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.840
And he says, we'll come back opening day.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.360
So that was October.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.040
You know, I go home, I think I have the job.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.440
I'm not, not really sure.

04:49.440 --> 04:55.440
And, you know, six months later, opening day in 1993, I show up at 9 a.m.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.720
I put on my jacket and tie.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.040
I walk back to the stadium.

04:59.040 --> 05:03.640
I go back downstairs, you know, through these tunnels and come to this, you know,

05:03.640 --> 05:07.960
big steel door that says Yankee Clubhouse on and I walk inside and it's complete

05:07.960 --> 05:08.760
pandemonium.

05:08.760 --> 05:14.520
And, you know, there's these ballplayers that I'd only seen before on TV or across

05:14.520 --> 05:16.320
rows and rows of stadium seats.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.280
And like they're there in the flesh in front of me.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.480
And Don Mattingly is over, you know, on the right.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.320
And I had a poster of Don Mattingly above my bed, you know, for my whole life.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.760
And he's standing right over there.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.680
And Jimmy Key, the ace of the pitching staff, is over there and all these guys.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.600
And, you know, opening day Yankee Stadium is not just a sports event, it's a news

05:33.600 --> 05:36.400
event. It's the beginning of spring in New York.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.600
And Mayor Dinkins is there with his entourage.

05:38.600 --> 05:45.000
And Mayor Dinkins and Don Mattingly, you know, it's so I'm walking around and just

05:45.000 --> 05:47.840
kind of lost. And I figure, you know, I better go find Nick.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.840
So I walk up to Nick and I say, Nick, what do you, you know, I'm mad.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.240
We met a couple of months ago.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.800
What do you want me to do?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.000
It's my first day of work.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.400
So he says, stay the f out of my way.

05:59.400 --> 06:05.040
So I kind of like shrink back and throw my backpack over on the side and just kind of

06:05.040 --> 06:06.080
wander around in a daze.

06:06.080 --> 06:10.200
And I feel a tap on my shoulder and I turn around and it's Don Mattingly.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.320
And he sticks his hand out and he says, how's it going?

06:13.320 --> 06:14.720
I'm Don Mattingly.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.840
Are you going to be working with us this year?

06:17.840 --> 06:22.040
Which, you know, even at that moment, I never really thought about the experience

06:22.040 --> 06:24.880
in those terms. And he could have said so many other things that wouldn't have been

06:24.880 --> 06:28.000
as cool as that. Like he could have said, you know, are you who are you?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.200
Or are you the new bad boy?

06:29.200 --> 06:30.800
Are you going to be working for us this year?

06:30.800 --> 06:32.400
But he said, you know, I'm Don Mattingly.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.920
Are you going to be working with us this year?

06:33.920 --> 06:36.640
So I said, I know who you are, Mr. Mattingly.

06:36.640 --> 06:37.960
I'm Matt. I'm the new bad boy.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.600
And he's like, great to meet you, Matt.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.960
I have a very big, very big job to ask of you.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.000
I've just unpacked all my bats from spring training.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.880
And I don't know if it was the altitude of the flight from Florida or the humidity

06:49.880 --> 06:52.760
down there or what. But the game starts in about two hours.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.720
And I need you to find me a bat stretcher.

06:55.720 --> 07:01.920
So I say, OK. So I go, I go and find Nick and I go, you know, Nick is busy.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.960
Probably half a dozen ballplayers are like bothering him for double A batteries or,

07:05.960 --> 07:08.720
you know, my hat size is my hat's too small or this or that.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.400
And I go up and I'm like, Nick, I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.840
And he lets loose with a stream of expletives that fell on, I swear,

07:15.840 --> 07:20.040
completely virgin ears like I'd never never heard that type of language

07:20.040 --> 07:22.960
in the movies before or anywhere, let alone directed at me.

07:22.960 --> 07:27.640
So I kind of like rock back on my heels and go and find somebody I can trust.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.840
Like Nick's assistant Rob. And I ask him, you know, I need a bat

07:30.840 --> 07:34.520
stretcher for Don Mattingly. And Nick told me to go f myself.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.960
And I don't know what to do. So he was like, chill out.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.560
You know, I saw Danny Tartable using one in his locker.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.320
So Danny Tartable is the, you know, powerheading right fielder.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.680
I go to his locker and he's getting dressed in his uniform.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.280
And I stand off on the side and he says, you know, how's it going?

07:51.280 --> 07:53.240
And I'm like, fine, I'm mad. I'm the new bat boy.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.680
I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly. And I heard you were just using one.

07:56.680 --> 08:00.440
So he's like, well, I was using one, but I left it in the manager's office.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.720
You should probably go check in there.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.760
So I say thanks.

08:04.760 --> 08:05.800
And he says, see you around.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.680
Then I go into the manager's office and walk in and Buck Showalter,

08:08.680 --> 08:13.480
the manager, is having a press conference with probably like eight or ten reporters.

08:13.480 --> 08:17.480
And I stand off on the side and I'm kind of, you know,

08:17.480 --> 08:20.840
the conversation comes to a standstill basically because there's a 16 year old kid

08:20.840 --> 08:26.280
there in his Easter blazer and jacket and standing in the manager's office

08:26.280 --> 08:29.040
in Yankee Stadium two hours before first pitch on opening day,

08:29.040 --> 08:31.600
looking very lost and very anxious.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.360
And Showalter turns to me and he's like, can I help you?

08:35.360 --> 08:37.280
And I say, I'm mad. I'm the new bat.

08:37.280 --> 08:41.200
I'm really sorry to interrupt, but I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.120
And Danny Tartable says that he left it in here.

08:43.120 --> 08:47.600
So Showalter looks down, like beneath his desk.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.720
And, you know, he's like, well, you know, do you need a right handed one or a left handed one?

08:53.720 --> 08:56.440
So this is the first moment all day that I actually, you know,

08:56.440 --> 08:59.680
this is the first question that I had that I could answer with complete confidence,

08:59.680 --> 09:02.120
because you couldn't have grown up in New York at that time, you know,

09:02.120 --> 09:05.000
without knowing that Mattingly was the best left handed hitter in baseball.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.600
So I say, I need a left handed bat stretcher.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.360
So he's like, well, I think we maybe have a right handed one around here,

09:12.360 --> 09:14.200
but probably not a left handed one.

09:14.200 --> 09:18.320
I'm like, you should try down at the Red Sox Clubhouse and see if they have one.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.920
So I say, OK, thanks.

09:20.920 --> 09:21.920
I'm sorry to interrupt.

09:21.920 --> 09:25.120
I go out. At this point, I'm like sprinting down the hallways,

09:25.200 --> 09:28.160
the tunnels beneath the stands, the first base stands at the stadium.

09:28.160 --> 09:31.280
And I run into the Red Sox Clubhouse and find their equipment manager

09:31.280 --> 09:32.440
and give him like the whole story.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.440
I'm at him. The new bat boy for the Yankees.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.240
And Danny Tartable left his right handed bat stretcher in Buck Showalter's office.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.560
I need a left handed one. And like the game's about to start.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.240
And he's like, calm down.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.600
Like, you know, we don't have one, but we need one.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.280
Like, here's 20 bucks.

09:47.280 --> 09:51.040
Go up to the Sporting Goods store on 161st Street and River Avenue and buy two.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.040
Like buy a left handed one for Mattingly and a right handed one for us.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.960
And then bring me back to change.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.840
So he gives me the 20. I put it in my pocket.

09:58.840 --> 09:59.800
I run upstairs.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.120
You know, at this point, it's like an hour before opening day.

10:02.440 --> 10:06.040
The fans are coming down, like 50,000 fans are coming down from,

10:06.160 --> 10:09.400
you know, the subway in the opposite direction that I'm walking.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.440
I'm the only person in the world who knows that, you know,

10:12.440 --> 10:14.760
if I don't come through on this mission, Mattingly is going to go up there

10:14.760 --> 10:18.160
against Roger Clemens and the Red Sox on opening day Yankee Stadium

10:18.160 --> 10:20.280
with a toothpick in his hand, basically.

10:21.280 --> 10:26.800
So I'm like fighting against the crowd and feeling so much weight on my shoulders.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.240
And I make my way, you know, and I'm about to cross the threshold

10:30.240 --> 10:33.680
of Stan's Sporting Goods when it dawns on me, like I've played

10:34.200 --> 10:38.240
a lot of baseball in my life and I've, you know, been a big fan for a while.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.920
And like, I don't even know what a bad stretcher looks like.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.400
And this moment that I'm like walking into the store,

10:45.400 --> 10:48.080
it dawns on me for the first first time, like, is

10:49.080 --> 10:51.480
is this a joke? Like, could this possibly

10:52.240 --> 10:53.640
could this possibly be a joke?

10:53.640 --> 10:57.400
And if it, you know, but I had so much fear because, like, if it is a joke

10:57.400 --> 11:01.000
and I go back and I tell Don Mattingly, you know, I'm too smart to fall for your,

11:01.000 --> 11:04.720
you know, your BS bat stretcher story and I'm wrong,

11:04.720 --> 11:08.040
I'm going to be back in the bleachers, like before my first game, you know,

11:08.040 --> 11:09.400
and lose my dream job.

11:09.400 --> 11:13.520
So, you know, I take three laps around the stadium, kind of convincing myself,

11:13.520 --> 11:16.360
like, it's got to be a joke, like, it's got to be it's got to be a joke.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.880
And I, you know, I walk back back in, I go down the stairs,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.080
I walk into the clubhouse.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.040
Mattingly winks at me from across the clubhouse.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.720
A couple of other ballplayers laugh.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.480
Mattingly goes three for five that day. Yankees win.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.720
It was my first day in pinstripes.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.360
And, you know, I didn't learn until later on that I was the first kid

11:34.360 --> 11:38.160
in anyone's memory to have gotten the job without having a connection,

11:38.160 --> 11:40.960
without, you know, somebody knowing somebody or my dad knowing somebody

11:40.960 --> 11:45.640
or or whatever, which was, you know, a lesson, a lesson in itself.

11:45.680 --> 11:50.840
And, you know, as intensely naive my pursuit of that job was, you know,

11:50.840 --> 11:54.560
I was probably as naively intense in chasing the bat stretcher.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.600
But, you know, the lesson in the story is, you know, when there's

12:00.520 --> 12:03.880
with a great deal of persistence and a little bit of common sense,

12:03.880 --> 12:05.680
even if the thing you're chasing may not exist,

12:05.680 --> 12:07.920
you can sometimes will it into being. Thank you.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.640
Thank you.

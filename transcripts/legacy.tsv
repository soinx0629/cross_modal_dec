0	12120	So, about a month into my daughter's kindergarten career, beginning of her being in school,
12120	22920	I was informed by her mother that her teacher was concerned about how she was doing in a
22920	26520	month into kindergarten.
26520	36160	You would think that there's not a whole lot that you need to know how to do, but apparently
36160	41280	my daughter was giving her teacher calls for concern.
41280	50880	And so, at the earliest opportunity, which was the parental observation day around Halloween,
50920	61280	I went in to observe the class and it was all very familiar and it was clear to me what
61280	67840	her teacher meant, even though it had been delivered to me in a really ambiguous and
67840	69160	hard to understand way.
69160	77520	I watched my daughter just be herself in this classroom, kind of blissfully unaware of what
77680	79800	was expected of her.
79800	84440	It seems all very innocent kindergarten and everything, but that's where they start training
84440	93600	you how to be a part of society, which if you're into that kind of thing, that's awesome.
93600	105200	But, you don't have much choice in this world, but so I'm watching her and watching her like
105360	111560	do her thing and watching her teacher get frustrated with her to the point of near anger
111560	119240	just because she's not jumping to the next thing that's being assigned to her because
119240	124600	they have little sections in the day or in the afternoon they have to work on.
124600	127240	It was very familiar.
127240	133280	A nice thing that can happen with having children is that you can see yourself and you can be
133360	139880	reminded of the progression of your own life through viewing them and I was brought back
139880	145920	to my experience being in kindergarten and I can see myself very clearly in my daughter.
145920	155520	We share a lot of similarities and I remember being handed rudimentary mathematics that
155520	160200	you're supposed to start in kindergarten and not being interested at all.
160200	165920	So not even bothering because it wasn't clear to me that it was like required.
165920	174480	It was clear to me that she was kind of in the same place and her teacher, besides rubbing
174480	180880	me the wrong way in a lot of ways, clearly didn't understand my daughter.
180880	183520	I didn't want my daughter to stay in that school.
183520	186400	I wanted her out.
186400	188080	And that could be just...
188080	194240	It's hard to say when you're dealing with your children because everyone thinks that
194240	205640	their children are God's gift to the planet or sane people do, sane people do.
205640	208000	So I wanted her out.
208000	212520	I didn't think it was a good place for her but I didn't think anything was wrong with
212520	219000	her but of course I didn't because I'm her father and it's very difficult to see your
219000	227080	children clearly because I would like to say because of the incredible amount of love that
227080	231440	you have for them but that's not totally honest because there's something besides the love,
231440	236920	there's ego involved because there's such reflection of you, you want them to do good,
236920	241920	you want them to be smart, you want them to be beautiful because you're smart and you're
241920	244200	beautiful and you dig it.
244200	249480	Or that's how you want to perceive yourself in this world and you want your children,
249480	252680	your offspring to have that.
252680	259080	That's maybe a little ugly but it's true and I think it's true for most parents.
259080	263920	So I do love my daughter a great deal and I love myself.
263920	277880	And I wanted her out of that school and her mother, a very fine woman, brilliant and beautiful,
277880	284040	we're partnered in raising her, we're not partnered romantically, didn't want to hear
284040	290040	me that maybe the teacher had the problem because she was beginning a career as a teacher
290080	297320	and she always heard parents talk about how it was a teacher's problem and that they wouldn't
297320	301880	be able to actually see their children and I had no idea how hard it was to be a teacher
301880	306320	with all these kids and blah blah blah.
306320	312720	Not blah blah blah, I'm sure she had points but we really, we're very, very good at disagreeing.
312720	315920	We can disagree very strongly.
316000	321800	I can see myself in my kid and I can see myself sitting at the kindergarten desk that she
321800	322800	was sitting at.
322800	328760	I can see the similarities and a lot of the similarities come down to an attribute that
328760	341680	is slowness, like a real slowness that we share that has been like frustrating to teachers
341680	355040	and parents and friends and lovers and roommates and any number of people.
355040	365520	For instance, it really can and often does take me an hour to put on my shoes and I can't
365520	370360	tell you where the time goes, it's not like I got distracted and started playing records
370400	377200	or something, like I can sit in the same place putting on my socks and shoes for an hour.
377200	378480	So can my daughter.
378480	386880	We can lose weekends just sitting on the toilet and if there's an apartment where I spend
386880	395880	time with my daughter, there's only one toilet so that's easy for me to see the similarities.
395880	400920	Thinking about how we see our children and how we see ourselves and our children and
400920	405200	how we want to see ourselves in a positive light, we don't want something to be wrong
405200	410200	with our children.
410200	417440	It makes me think about a moment in time when I was 17 years old and I was watching television
417440	425600	with my father, episode of Nova, it's like a science program that was on, I think it
425600	429880	was on PBS, I don't know if it still exists.
429880	440440	This one was on neuroscience and neuroscience technology and there had a guy getting prepared
440480	449400	for a CAT scan and being, receiving a CAT scan and it filled me with this crazy wave
449400	456880	of like deja vu but not just regular deja vu, like deja vu mixed with dread and like sickness
456880	466640	to my stomach and it was overwhelming and I couldn't stop thinking about it and wondering
467480	468480	did I have a CAT scan?
468480	471560	So I turned to my father and asked him if I had a CAT scan.
471560	478360	He said no and fell back asleep and then I couldn't get out of my head and I started
478360	485640	remembering more and more this experience of being a little kid and getting a CAT scan.
485640	492920	I finally went to my mother, asked her and she didn't want to talk about it and I persisted
492920	502120	and she admitted that I had had a CAT scan when I was six years old, something like that
502120	511880	and I asked her why I had had a CAT scan and she didn't want to talk about it but she started
511880	523280	laughing a little bit, which is weird, from where I was standing, kind of filled with
523280	533480	dread and having this repressed memory come up and finally she admitted I had had a CAT
533480	535080	scan and she told me why.
535080	547520	She said that I was so slow that they thought that I was retarded and I'd be given a battery
547520	553280	of tests to test my cognitive ability and the tests were inconclusive and they couldn't
553280	565400	figure out, the jury's still out, trust me, but the tests were inconclusive so they thought
565400	573400	that maybe I just had a brain tumor and so that's why I got the CAT scan.
573400	582840	I don't know if you've ever had one but I don't even like giving blood for a blood test.
582840	589560	I don't, this is actually, thinking about it right now, probably exactly why I hate
589560	595840	Western medicine entirely and will do anything to stay away from a doctor.
595840	603000	With a CAT scan, they have to like take your clothes off if you're little and you don't
603000	609320	want to take your clothes off in a room full of strangers and then they, this is my memory
609800	616520	so I don't know, they inject something into your ankle like an iodine solution and then
616520	624480	they lay you on a table and you get slid into a tube that sends whatever rays through your
624480	630880	body to look into your brain to see what's going on.
630880	634960	Totally fucking terrifying.
634960	643160	I remembered trying to escape, I remembered screaming until I was hoarse, I remembered
643160	651800	my father coming into the room and talking me down and I remember having my clothes put
651800	659080	back on and taken to the gift shop and my father bought me a book of animal limericks
659200	666200	and rhymes and photographs of the animals, all these animals from North America, black
666200	667200	hard covered book.
667200	671600	I remembered that book and I had it for childhood but I didn't remember anything about the CAT
671600	677200	scan after I left the hospital because it sucked that bad.
677200	689000	My parents loved, loved me, loved their children and that couldn't have been anything but
689000	699280	painful and frightening from my father too, you know, the whole situation and so I'm just
699280	706320	thinking about what motivated them to go to that extreme to see what was wrong with me.
706320	716040	So it turns out that no brain tumor as a child, just slow, I'm just slow.
716080	722960	I've figured out ways to live my life that it doesn't really matter as far as survival
722960	735560	is concerned and actually I've been able to thrive, you know, by degrees and I had to
735560	743160	think about that, it's so tempting to sing, so tempting to push it so past the time that
743280	748720	she starts playing and I have to improvise a song on top of it to finish the story.
748720	753600	I won't do that.
753600	761400	Just thinking about not doing that to my child, you know, having the good fortune to have
761400	769360	a child that's so much like me that I can take my experiences and help her, at least
769360	772160	in this moment, I don't know what the future holds and I don't know who she's going to
772160	783880	become, you know, but I can use my experience in a way to lessen her potential problems
783880	791120	in this world, which is what you ultimately, ultimately, ultimately wish for as a parent.
791120	798120	Her mother went to talk to the teacher a couple weeks later and came back horrified and wanted
798120	806560	to, but she's not a violent person, but she wanted our daughter out too.
806560	810520	So we took our daughter out of that school, she's now at a Steiner school, which really
810520	814520	suits her much better and we're both slow.

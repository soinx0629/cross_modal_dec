1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Felly rydw i'n ymwneud yn y botwm ffon ac rydw i'n rhoi £0.20 yn ymwneud ac rydw i'n ffon fy ffrind, ac mae'n cymryd.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Felly rydw i'n rhoi £0.50 yn ymwneud.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ac roedden ni'n mynd i ddweud.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Rydw i'n teimlo'r ddau yn ôl i mi.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Rydw i'n mynd i ddweud.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Rydw i'n mynd i ddweud.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Rydw i'n teimlo'r ddau yn ôl i'r botwm ffon ac rydw i'n gweld ychwanegu'r ddau.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yn ystod y tu allan, roeddwn i'n byw ar y fflat fy ffrind.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Roedd hi'n byw ar y camys Unedig yn y Cynulliad Cymru.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Roedd hi'n byw ar gyfer gwaith ac roedd hi wedi rhoi'r llwybr i'n fflat,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
allwn i'n byw ar y camys Unedig,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
unrhyw lle yn Hansworth Ward,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
ond pan oeddwn i'n byw ar y fflat yn y Llyfrgell,

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
roeddwn i'n dechrau bod yn sianol i'n mynd i'n mynd i hefyd.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Roeddwn i'n byw ym mhob.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Roeddwn i'n byw ym mhob, roeddwn i'n byw yn y ddau,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
ac roeddwn i'n byw ar fy mhob.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,980
Oherwydd o'r hyn, roedd y ffordd yn fy holl ddweud,

19
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,920
dweud dweud dweud,

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,600
ond rwy'n gwybod i dweud.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,920
Ac un o'r ffordd, roedd y ffordd dweud dweud,

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,600
dweud dweud dweud.

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,720
Now to tell you the truth,

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,920
I wasn't really sure what to make of this voice.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,520
It made me quite anxious,

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
but I couldn't quite figure out what it meant

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,780
or what could possibly happen.

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,040
And I had to think about it for a while.

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,880
And eventually I decided,

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,640
no, I'm going to go home.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,800
But to appease this voice in my head,

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,560
I decided to remove my jewellery, my watch,

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,280
leave my cards behind and my cash,

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,360
but just take enough money for my bus fare there

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
and to return the following morning

36
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,080
and enough also to phone my boyfriend

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,640
from the payphone on campus.

38
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,440
And so I set off.

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,640
And it was probably about, I don't know,

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,600
8.30 in the evening.

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,280
So I was studying in Birmingham

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,320
and their subways, particularly when I was there,

43
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,640
had a reputation for being quite seedy and unsafe.

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,040
And I had actually been flashed at

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,760
a number of times down there.

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,440
But on this particular occasion,

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,200
as I walked through the tunnel,

48
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,520
I noticed a female police officer ahead of me.

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,240
And I remember thinking this was a good omen.

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,560
I kind of broke my stride

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,440
so we were almost walking in tandem

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,200
without making it too obvious.

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,960
And then I exit the subway

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,240
and I get to my bus stop.

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,600
And usually, regardless of what the timetable says,

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,720
I always have to wait half an hour for my bus.

57
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,960
But on this particular evening,

58
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,600
it comes within minutes.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,240
So when I get on the bus,

60
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,840
I actually sit near the bus driver

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,560
because I think this is the most sensible thing to do.

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,520
And then I arrive at my stop.

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,160
And at this point, I'd say,

64
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,800
I'm pretty much on the home stretch.

65
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,440
All I have to do now is get home.

66
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,520
And as I'm walking along the street,

67
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,200
I suddenly notice an empty phone box on the corner.

68
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
And in that moment, I decide,

69
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm going to call my boyfriend from there.

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,160
Now, I make this decision

71
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,640
because the payphone on my campus serves about 50 people

72
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,600
and it's always ringing off the hook.

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,760
So if I really want to speak to my boyfriend tonight,

74
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,480
this is my best chance.

75
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,720
I realise at this point,

76
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,800
I'm slightly deviating from the plan

77
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,960
of just going straight home.

78
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,880
But I can distinctly remember

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,280
as I felt the door close behind me.

80
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm safe in here.

81
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,960
It's a box.

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,880
So I put my money in and I call my boyfriend.

83
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,720
And then suddenly, I feel the door behind me open.

84
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,400
A hand appears out of nowhere

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,480
and I watch it press down the switch hook of the phone.

86
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,000
I hear the pound coin drop to the bottom

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and I watch this hand remove the coin.

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,280
I don't remember dropping the receiver,

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,320
but I do remember seeing it swing from side to side.

90
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,440
Suddenly, these arms tighten around me

91
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,560
and I can feel something sharp against my neck.

92
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,080
And I'm scared.

93
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm so scared.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,440
My mouth is dry and I can hardly breathe

95
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,440
and my heart is beating so fast,

96
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,760
I can feel it pulsing in the back of my throat

97
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,240
like at any moment it could just rip through.

98
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,680
And I'm fighting so hard to stop my knees from buckling.

99
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,080
And I keep saying to myself over and over again,

100
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
is this happening?

101
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,240
This isn't happening.

102
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,480
Is this really happening?

103
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,480
I think I'm told not to move or make a sound,

104
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,440
but I can't be sure.

105
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,280
He asks me for money, but I don't have any.

106
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,680
No, wait, I do.

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,240
I have 75 pence.

108
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,920
I think he thinks I'm mocking him,

109
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,320
so I give him my bag and he turns me around

110
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,560
and he pushes me up against the phone.

111
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,760
And through the sheer panic of it all,

112
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,560
something happened to me.

113
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,520
I was suddenly overcome by this strange sense

114
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,680
of calm, presence and lucidity.

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,680
My senses were heightened

116
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,560
and I could feel and sense everything around me.

117
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,040
It was like I was inhabiting every cell of my body

118
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,800
and I think time must have stood still or something

119
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,160
because after that everything happened in slow motion.

120
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,080
The voice in my head asks me,

121
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,520
so how does this end?

122
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,160
What happens now?

123
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,040
And so I start running through all these different scenarios

124
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
in my mind.

125
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,160
Or maybe I'm stabbed and I die.

126
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,560
Or maybe I'm raped, stabbed and then I die.

127
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,520
Or maybe, maybe I'm stabbed,

128
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
but I go into intensive care,

129
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,680
but then I slip into a coma and then I die.

130
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,920
And the voice says,

131
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,320
well, whatever way you look at this,

132
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,680
you really have nothing to lose.

133
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,920
But if you do survive, the police will want a description.

134
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,840
You need to get a description.

135
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,320
So I slowly raise my hands and I turn around to face him.

136
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,440
And I tell him to check my pockets for money

137
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,400
just in case he doesn't believe me.

138
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,040
And as he does, I look at him

139
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,560
and I take the image of him in.

140
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,800
The colour of his hair, his eyes,

141
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
his clothing, his height,

142
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,400
and the Stanley knife in his hand.

143
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,360
He looks up and he notices the tracking movements of my eyes

144
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,160
and he quickly turns me around

145
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,320
and he forces me up against the phone.

146
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,920
His hands start to move over my breasts.

147
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,000
And the voice says, don't move.

148
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,800
Don't even flinch.

149
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
Let him touch you.

150
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,320
Let him think he has you.

151
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,960
And so I do.

152
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,560
Let him touch me.

153
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,920
And for a brief moment,

154
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,960
I can almost sense a slight release of tension in his arm.

155
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,600
And all the while, I kept thinking to myself,

156
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
how did I get into the phone box?

157
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,520
Which way did the door open?

158
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
What side of the door was the handle on?

159
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,960
Which hand did I use?

160
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Meanwhile, his hands are travelling downwards

161
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,520
towards my groin.

162
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,000
And in that moment, I decide,

163
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,840
I'd rather die.

164
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,520
I grab his arms and I use my weight

165
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,840
to push him backwards into the door.

166
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,240
And using my elbows, I swing to the right

167
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,040
so that as I swing to the left,

168
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,160
I use his weight to leverage the door open.

169
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,720
And the door opens and so I run.

170
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
And I'm screaming, I think.

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,520
But then I stop running

172
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,000
because I realise very quickly

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,240
he's not chasing me.

174
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
He's run away.

175
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,800
I don't know what it was in that moment

176
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,800
if it was just the effects of the adrenaline.

177
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,960
But all I wanted to do was find him

178
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,320
so that I could stab him and kill him.

179
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,400
But as I'm looking around, I don't see anyone,

180
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,360
apart from an Indian man standing in the driveway

181
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,880
of his house next to his car.

182
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,160
He shouts to me, are you okay?

183
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,120
Of course I'm not okay, I've just been mugged.

184
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,440
Which way did he go?

185
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,400
I start running down a dark road

186
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,720
and the man chases me and brings me back,

187
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,920
telling me it's not a good idea.

188
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,400
He walks me to the phone box

189
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,320
where I pick up my bag and I replace the handset.

190
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,840
And the phone rings.

191
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,960
And so, for some bizarre reason, I answer it.

192
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,000
It's my boyfriend.

193
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,160
He tells me he's been trying to call me

194
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,080
for the last two minutes.

195
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,880
What?

196
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,960
Are you sure?

197
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,200
I hang up and then the Indian man offers to drive me home.

198
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,920
I tell him he's crazy, I'm not getting in a car with you.

199
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,360
You're a stranger, you're a man.

200
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,960
He offers to bring his wife along so that I feel safe.

201
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
It's just that now I have to wait for her

202
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,680
because she has to get ready and get her purse.

203
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,040
So as I stand outside the door,

204
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,640
waiting for her,

205
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,680
every single member of the family appears at the door

206
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,400
wanting to know what happened,

207
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,320
wanting to come along for the ride.

208
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,960
Eventually, everyone is seated in the car.

209
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,120
Everyone except for me.

210
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,240
There's no room for me to sit.

211
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,800
Someone has to get out of the car

212
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,720
so that I can get in, so that I can go home.

213
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,400
Eventually, it's agreed that the grandfather will stay behind.

214
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,440
The drive is excruciatingly slow

215
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,440
owing to the weight of the car and so claustrophobic.

216
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,520
I burst into tears and the grandmother says,

217
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,680
stop crying, what are you crying for?

218
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,240
It's not like you were raped.

219
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,520
Oh, wait a minute, she says.

220
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,880
He didn't touch you down there, did he?

221
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
No?

222
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,760
Well, that's all right then

223
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,120
because otherwise you would have been spoiled.

224
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
We get to the car park and I ask to be let down.

225
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,240
They offer to walk me to my door and I flat out refuse.

226
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,560
As I watch the car pull away,

227
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,000
I realise as I stand in this dark car park,

228
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,760
I'm breathing again.

229
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,080
It's only in that moment I realise I'm home.

230
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,440
I made it home.

231
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
Thank you.

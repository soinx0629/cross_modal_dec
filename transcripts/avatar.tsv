0	15520	Tom Waits loved the novel J.T. Leroy had written called Sarah. He wanted to do an
15520	26920	interview with J.T. Leroy for Vanity Fair magazine and he wanted J.T.'s input on who
26960	37440	would photograph the spread because J.T. Leroy was notoriously shy. One of the reasons why
37440	49800	J.T. was so shy was because J.T. didn't have a body. J.T. was an avatar. So let me take you
49800	60000	back some years. I was 16, 17 years old and I was awarded the state in a group home in
60000	74200	New York City. Eight girls, one bathroom. And the girls had all had stories being some had
74200	83240	been raped, stabbed by a parent, sold into slavery. Everyone had secrets. At night time,
83240	91240	we'd tell our secrets and you couldn't tell. And I was the one they would come to and tell
91240	98560	their stories. And if you asked me why I was there, I don't know. All the intakes,
98640	110520	dysfunctional family, I dropped out of school, I don't know. But I was always interested in
110520	117040	how do you tell? And there was this movie, Streetwise, it was a documentary by Mariel and Mark
117040	126360	about homeless kids in Seattle. And I gathered up some of my friends, my best friend Lauren from
126360	133640	the group home. We'd been institutionalized together prior to the group home. And we went
133640	145760	and saw this movie. And we saw ourselves on the screen. Now the street can seduce you. And these
145760	156040	kids were getting swallowed. And we knew we were just one step removed. And when we left the movie,
156040	162120	I saw how people looked at us right before they were kind of scared of us. And I got off on that,
162120	169160	you know, because we'd street all over us. But after the movie, they looked at us with this kind
169160	178960	of curious compassion. And suddenly, I didn't want to be the victim in the movie. I was interested
178960	184840	in how do you make that bridge so people suddenly care and curious enough to maybe
185080	195920	care? How do you do that? And in the group home, everyone's telling their stories. And I don't even
195920	203360	know how to tell mine. I don't even have the tools to tell mine. And I would go to buy a little relief
203360	211040	to a street corner. There's a phone booth right on the corner. And I would remove it from me. I'd be
211040	218240	a boy. And I'd call hotlines. And I'd tell them all the stories, my story, my pain, everyone's
218240	224160	stories, the houseparent who survived the Biafran Wars, and say to me, Laura, your job is to tell
224160	230840	our stories. Because in the group home, my job was I was the translator. So some girls having some
230840	236000	problems with the houseparent, they'd come to me and I would translate between what each other was
236000	247120	saying. Again, if you asked me, I don't know. All I knew is if you heard what my story was,
247120	256880	my deepest belief was that you would say, well, you deserve it. You're disgusting. You're horrible.
257760	267120	My deepest hope was that you wouldn't. But I never ever gave you the chance. But I wanted to learn the
267120	275400	tools to tell because that's the bridge. And I won a scholarship to the New School for Social Research.
275400	281000	And they let me in without the SATs. I said, I can't take the SATs. My last grade of completion is
281000	292320	six. And they let me in with an essay. I'm taking every writing class I can get my hands on. And I
292320	299840	wrote this piece in this class about, you can tell a kid that's not going to survive long on the street
299840	306840	because the scars run this way. And the kids are there wrapped in wrapped, you know. And everyone's
306920	315080	looking to see whose exterior matches the story. And everyone's looking at this one cool guy. He's
315080	322200	all raggedy. And I'm in the group home. And I'm just looking. I'm looking at him too. And I want it to be
322200	327880	him because he matches the voice. And I don't want them to know it's me because it's going to ruin it.
329400	335000	I want it to be him. And then when they leave, because they don't know it was anonymous reading
335000	341640	the story. And then when we leave, I hear people talking about, wow, I never thought of it that way.
341640	349800	I didn't know that about the scene. And I'm like, that's what I want. How do you get people to see
349800	362400	what they never saw before? They never knew before. I keep writing, but never as myself. The writing
362400	378880	gives me a little more relief. I start writing under the name Jeremy, which becomes JT. For me,
381360	388240	I buy myself another day every time I can find a way to tell, but as long
388240	397120	as it's not coming from me, never as a woman. So when I get asked by Tom Waits,
397120	405440	when he asked JT Leroy who he wants to photograph, Mary Ellen Mark, my sister-in-law came over one day
405440	413280	and she just shaved her head. And I'm looking at her and she looks like the blonde hair, blue-eyed
413280	417600	little boys that I would see in the after school specials when they were just starting to talk
417600	425920	about abuse, sexual abuse. Always a blonde hair, blue-eyed cute little boy that you would forgive
425920	432800	and love no matter what they did, no matter how transgressive and bad they were. You just love them.
433840	446240	I never saw myself represented in any of that. So she looked. She was JT. And she agreed to be my
446240	453600	avatar. Now, Mary Ellen Mark said that the person she was photographing did not feel like somebody
453600	460560	who had suffered, like someone. It felt like someone who maybe came from privilege, but she said the
460560	470640	books needed to be in the world, that the book showed a world she had never seen, that she wanted
470640	484400	the books to be out there. And she photographed the avatar. I continued to publish under the name JT
484400	497840	Leroy. I wrote the book Sarah, which was received with great acclaim. I published it as fiction,
497840	512800	all my work as fiction. Came to pass that this book that explored the wilds of West Virginia,
513440	519360	a state I had never been in, in this kind of magical, I play with gender and identity and
519360	527680	it's the spirit, everything that I had experienced, all the pain, all the suffering, the joy, the hope,
528160	534000	holding on to finding that a possibility of being saved no matter what, the spirit,
534640	544400	the humor, it was all in there turned upside down. In this book, Sarah came to pass that I am revealed
544400	556240	as JT Leroy. The articulation in the New York Times is hoax, perpetrator, culprit, the jig is up,
556240	566880	come clean, liar, fake fiction writer. No, New York Times, fake fiction writer.
571360	575440	Oscar Wilde said, give a man a mask and he'll tell you the truth.
576000	584880	I received death threats, hate mail, was blacklisted, sued in federal f*****g court.
590640	597440	People didn't understand why I wouldn't apologize. She won't apologize. I wouldn't,
598160	603440	how could you apologize for what kept, it kept me alive? I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it.
603440	609040	It kept me alive. I couldn't do it another way. I knew no other way.
613440	620160	Slowly the fan mail came back. I would get letters where people would talk about what the work meant
620160	626640	to it, how it transformed them, how it saved their lives, how it allowed them to see a world
626640	635840	that they had never seen before. I got invited to speak, welcome back into the community of artists,
636960	644400	to speak all over the world. In spring, I did a sold out reading at Foyles in London
647040	650480	and I'm signing books as me
651360	658400	and these collectors are there and, you know, I'm signing books where, editions in languages
658400	666400	that I didn't even know existed and sign this, sign this, sign this and I'm leaving my body
669760	673360	and all of a sudden the crowds kind of part
674240	682480	and this girl comes walking towards me. She's big and she's got cuts all over her arms.
683680	690480	She's carrying a bag and I know what's coming. It's what I've been preparing for my whole life.
693520	697120	She reaches in her bag and I know she's going to stab me
697920	707040	and she takes out a book and she tells me that she came to my work after the reveal.
710720	714400	She asks me to sign her diary.
715360	719040	She asks me to sign her diary.
725120	734400	I realize that everything that had happened up to that moment had prepared me for this
737200	738000	and I got up
740640	741600	and I held her.
744400	754000	Thank you.

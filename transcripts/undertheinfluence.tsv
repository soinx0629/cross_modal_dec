0	1380	In all honesty, I'm going to start
1380	6140	by admitting that I sometimes lie.
6140	8060	Occasionally, I'll include a lie in a story
8060	11420	I'm telling if I think it'll make the story better.
11420	13340	I don't do it to protect the innocent,
13340	14840	because I don't know any stories where
14840	17300	the people in them are innocent.
17300	19180	And I don't do it to be shocking either,
19180	23020	though I admit to once telling a story where I exaggerated
23020	26220	the length of my penis.
26220	29020	In my own defense, I exaggerated down and not up.
29040	32640	And I did it for the laugh.
32640	36160	The story I'm telling you tonight does not have a lie in it,
36160	37800	or many laughs for that matter.
37800	39880	When I'm done telling you this story, you may think
39880	44400	it's nothing but a lie, but I'd ask you to trust me on this.
44400	48240	At the age of 19, I fell prey to a powerful and deeply
48240	50400	corrupting influence.
50400	53840	It dogged me for six years, costing me many a friend,
53840	57520	and in the process bringing my family to ruin.
57520	59460	It crippled me to such an extent that I
59460	63740	have spent the intervening 15 years recovering from it.
63740	65420	The influence I speak of is hope.
69220	70500	Now, you should know at the get go,
70500	72860	there's nothing in my childhood to suggest
72860	76220	I might find myself on such a wayward path as that.
76220	78100	My parents loved me terribly.
78100	80500	They taught me right from wrong.
80500	83500	They taught me to be courageous in the face of bullies.
83500	85960	They taught me patience and forgiveness.
85960	88100	They taught me that love would see you
88100	91220	through any misfortune.
91220	93540	My trouble began on Independence Day.
93540	96380	Not the Independence Day, but my Independence Day.
96380	99660	My Independence Day occurred on Memorial Day, 1982.
99660	103100	That was the day I told my family I was gay.
103100	107460	The act itself, mom, dad, I'm gay,
107460	109420	was relatively unexceptional.
109420	111380	In fact, it should have been more exceptional,
111380	114180	and I've always sort of wished that it had been.
114180	116520	However, subsequent events overshadowed it,
116520	119280	and it pales by comparison.
119280	121400	The subsequent events occurred in my absence,
121400	124360	after the fact, as I was in my car driving back to college
124360	126560	to take my final freshman exams.
126560	128560	I remember being on the highway and thinking
128560	131960	how I kind of expected my parents to freak out a little.
131960	134400	And to my surprise, they had not freaked out.
134400	137760	They'd been calm and cool and collected,
137760	139500	oddly calm, cool, and collected.
139500	142520	But still, I was really happy as I drove back to school.
142520	144020	Meanwhile, subsequent events were
144020	146460	busy unfolding back home.
146460	149020	My mother was going through the house where I grew up
149020	151820	and was gathering together things I had made for her.
151820	156620	A jewelry box when I was in 4-H, and a painting when I was 16.
156620	159440	A box containing the letters that I'd
159440	163020	written them from school, which I used to do every week.
163020	164940	She was removing photographs from the walls
164940	167460	and placing them in little piles around the house.
167460	170780	And she was directing my father, who never dared not follow
170840	174400	her direction, to take the bed and the desk and the chair
174400	177880	and the lamp and the Smith Corona, Smith Corona even,
177880	181480	and to put them all in the front yard next to the rock garden,
181480	185240	not too close to the maple tree.
185240	190360	My clothes, my books, my bookcases, my report cards,
190360	192920	my Farrah Fawcett posters, my shoes,
192920	194760	three years worth of interview magazines,
194760	200160	the good ones with the Andy Warhol covers, everything.
200160	203020	Then with my brother and my sister and my grandparents
203020	205420	watching, my mother removed a cigarette
205420	208260	from this tiny crocheted case she always kept them in.
208260	210780	And she lit the cigarette, and then she took the match
210780	213780	and put it to the pile of things there in the front yard that
213780	216720	contained the sole and complete record of my existence
216720	217380	and my family.
220660	222860	It burned for 7 and 1 half hours,
222860	225020	thanks in part to the addition of some lighter fluid
225020	229060	to help get the larger pieces of furniture going.
229060	233280	All of it, all that was me prior to that memorable Memorial
233280	235840	Day up in flames.
235840	238240	According to my sister, who years later recounted
238240	244440	these details to me, it was a mighty impressive blaze.
244440	248240	In their eagerness to feed it, and due to an unexpected wind
248240	251280	off the fields around the house, the sugar maple
251280	252880	that was older than my great grandfather
252880	256160	caught a spark in its branches and was sacrificed.
259240	261920	They cut off all communication with me.
261920	265320	They emptied and closed our joint bank account.
265320	267040	There goes college.
267040	268480	They barred the door.
268480	271160	They stopped talking, stopped answering my letters,
271160	272280	stopped taking my calls.
272280	273920	They stopped anything with me.
273920	277560	They just stopped.
277560	280320	I was completely disbelieving.
280320	282200	I mean, this didn't make any sense.
282200	284120	All of my friends had stories about telling
284120	286160	their families they were gay, and they all ended the same way.
286160	288280	Sooner or later, everything worked out fine.
288340	290540	So I even had a friend named Neil,
290540	292260	whose parents had done the same thing.
292260	294500	At first, they just stopped talking to him.
294500	297220	But one year later, they were inviting his new boyfriend
297220	300020	to come home with him for the holidays.
300020	302780	Everyone counseled me to have a little patience
302780	305140	and have a little hope.
305140	309300	And this is how it starts, slowly, just a little hope,
309300	312380	just enough to get you through.
312380	314420	But hope is cumulative.
314420	316500	A little bit here and a little bit there,
316520	320120	it builds up in the system until it becomes something toxic.
320120	321920	Denial.
321920	325440	I mean, their reaction had been, yes, extreme,
325440	327480	but not the worst that could happen.
327480	330280	The thing to do was to be a good son, to make them proud,
330280	333120	to earn back their love.
333120	336360	So I got a job, and then another, and then a third.
336360	340760	Three shifts, three restaurants, six days a week.
340760	343520	That would show them.
343520	346240	But they weren't watching.
346240	349980	I wrote them letters, lots of letters, about nothing.
349980	352100	It's Tuesday, and it's hot.
352100	355060	Or my new roommate is named Kathy.
355060	358740	Or my friends took me out for my birthday yesterday.
358740	361060	They didn't write back.
361060	363820	Living, for me, sort of came to a halt,
363820	366260	despite the fact that my life just went on and on.
366260	367580	I didn't think about my future.
367580	368860	I didn't think about my needs.
368860	370380	I didn't think about my sadness.
370380	371540	I didn't think about any of it.
371540	373100	I didn't have to, because I had hope.
373100	375700	Every day, whispering in my ear, don't give up.
375700	376800	Don't walk away.
376800	377800	You're almost there.
377800	378720	Don't stop.
378720	379360	Don't grow.
379360	380680	Don't develop.
380680	381640	Don't worry.
381640	384040	Just don't make any sudden movements, or you'll blow it.
390280	393480	So six years went on like this, without a word from them.
393480	398920	So finally, hurt and confused beyond my ability
398920	400960	to hold it in, and frankly, finding it really
400960	402440	difficult to maintain the illusion
402440	404120	that this was temporary.
404140	410740	I decided to make one more attempt to force the issue.
410740	414980	So I flew home and showed up unannounced at my mother's
414980	417700	office.
417700	418940	It was an amazing visit.
426660	430180	I asked the receptionist to page my mother
430180	432060	and tell her she had a surprise visitor.
435100	437860	And I stood there in the lobby, and I
437860	440180	remember seeing my mother come down this long hallway
440180	441740	toward me.
441740	445260	And she was walking, and then she sort of looked up,
445260	448260	and she saw me.
448260	451900	And then she recognized who it was,
451900	455180	and she turned and walked away again.
455180	460020	It was a really amazing 90-second visit.
460020	463060	Two and a half weeks later, a black funeral wreath
463060	465120	was delivered to me at my office with a note that
465120	470040	said, in memory of our son.
470040	472720	Clearly, it was time to give up hope and take up therapy.
476600	479680	So I talked to a counselor who asked me
479680	483720	why I had invited this turmoil into my life.
483720	486440	I talked to a minister who suggested a Christian youth
486440	486940	camp.
487940	493860	I talked to a lesbian who offered
493860	498700	to slash my mother's tires if I paid for her flight there.
498700	500240	I signed up for scream therapy, where
500240	501700	I beat pillows with tennis rackets
501700	503740	and screamed obscenities and pulled
503740	505180	a muscle in my shoulder.
505180	510260	Mostly I talked to friends, and mostly the pain persisted.
510260	513060	The sheer weight of it nearly crushed me,
513060	515740	or at least that's how it felt at the time.
515780	517700	Since it was my constant companion,
517700	522620	I spent most of my time turning it over in my mind,
522620	527120	fingering it like some sort of psychological worry stone.
527120	531680	Over the years, it's been eroded by so much handling.
531680	537500	All that remains now is a small, hard, nearly weightless pebble,
537500	538920	really.
538920	542680	Worn away is most of the anger and much of the hurt.
542680	544540	But one question remains.
544540	546420	How was it possible that they taught me
546420	549300	love and loyalty in excess of that which they themselves
549300	549800	possessed?
554580	556500	I have come to believe that it's not
556500	558580	possible to understand what they did.
558580	560900	Not possible for me, anyway.
560900	565060	To understand it would seem to indicate
565060	566820	that there was some justification for it,
566820	570020	and I know for certain that there is not.
570020	573900	Still, there's no escaping my parents.
573900	578100	This thing they did, this extreme and unfathomable
578100	580340	and many layered thing they did, tore a hole
580340	582420	in the middle of my life.
582420	586460	I have spent years and a lot of money
586460	589860	darning that hole while trying to keep the rest of my world
589860	592020	from unraveling.
592020	594500	And yet, their influence on me is enduring.
597420	601020	My parents loved me terribly.
601020	604940	I have been courageous in the face of bullies.
604940	608860	There is such a thing as too much patience,
608860	613660	but no such thing as too much forgiveness.
613660	618220	And love has seen me through every misfortune.
618220	619780	Thank you.

00:00.000 --> 00:12.300
So, I'm sitting in my shrink's office this one time, and he says to me, how's it going?

00:12.300 --> 00:20.100
And I say, well, to be honest, Doc, I had a really, really horrible experience the other

00:20.100 --> 00:21.100
day.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.820
And he says, tell me about it.

00:22.820 --> 00:27.380
And I say, well, it all started when I was laying on my couch.

00:27.380 --> 00:31.720
And he looks at me and he says, really?

00:31.720 --> 00:37.520
Which if you know me, is an incredibly funny thing for him to say, because I have probably

00:37.520 --> 00:48.140
spent more time lying on couches than any able-bodied man under the age of, say, 110

00:48.140 --> 00:50.460
living today.

00:50.500 --> 00:59.180
If lying on couches was a martial art, I would have a ninth-level black belt ninja master

00:59.180 --> 01:03.100
status in it.

01:03.100 --> 01:07.480
As a matter of fact, when I was originally asked by the moth to do this event, and they

01:07.480 --> 01:13.600
explained about the seven deadly sins, I was amazed that sloth was even still available.

01:13.600 --> 01:19.340
I assumed that sloth would be the first sin picked, because it is really the central thing

01:19.340 --> 01:21.920
about our culture, isn't it?

01:21.920 --> 01:31.300
We live in a whole society based on consumer entertainment and luxury effort reduction.

01:31.300 --> 01:37.840
But within that culture, my own generation, which they used to call Gen X or slackers,

01:37.840 --> 01:43.000
really distinguished itself, even among the general culture.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.460
And within that elite group of underachievers, I distinguished myself as really a super-achiever

01:50.460 --> 01:53.600
of underachievement.

01:53.600 --> 01:59.200
If sloth is a sin, I think it's fair to say I'm really guilty of, like, Milosevic-level

01:59.200 --> 02:03.920
crimes against humanity.

02:03.920 --> 02:09.680
And if the Vatican conducted its affairs the way that governments do, there would be some

02:09.680 --> 02:17.700
sort of secret Vatican sniper up in these windows ready to take me out right now.

02:17.700 --> 02:22.800
I lived for years and years and years just bumming around this wonderful college town

02:22.800 --> 02:25.200
called Madison, Wisconsin.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.200
And did people know Madison?

02:27.200 --> 02:28.200
Great.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.200
That's fantastic.

02:29.200 --> 02:35.000
And we had a whole culture there that was essentially built around couches.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.880
Everything was centered around the living room, because what your life consisted of

02:39.880 --> 02:46.920
was every second that you weren't slaving away at your shitty minimum wage job.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.880
And that's, I'd like to dispel, a myth about slackers right now, which is that they don't

02:49.880 --> 02:51.500
work hard.

02:51.500 --> 02:55.480
Because in order to live a life of sloth, you really have to work like a slave to do

02:55.480 --> 02:56.480
it.

02:56.480 --> 03:01.160
Because opting out of the career rat race essentially means opting into the working

03:01.160 --> 03:06.080
poor.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.120
And so every second that you weren't at that job, you were sitting in your living room,

03:10.120 --> 03:17.200
sitting with your friends, you're watching TV, you're smoking pot, you're listening

03:17.200 --> 03:22.900
to rock and roll and watching DVDs, but mainly just engaging in conversation.

03:22.900 --> 03:30.360
And you're trying to wring every last ounce of leisure, of luxury effort reduction out

03:30.400 --> 03:37.120
of the remaining hours before your shift at the job you hate starts again.

03:37.120 --> 03:41.600
We had a wonderful tradition in Madison, because every year when the students would move, the

03:41.600 --> 03:47.320
frat guys would leave their furniture abandoned by the side of the road.

03:47.320 --> 03:54.560
And so every year you would take the cigarette hole burned, beer stained, vomit smelling

03:54.760 --> 03:59.920
couch that just stank like weed and cigarettes.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.880
And you would pick it up and you'd march it out of the house and you'd set it down and

04:02.880 --> 04:06.640
then you'd go get a brand new couch from the frat kids and you'd move it into the empty

04:06.640 --> 04:11.040
space where you had the previous couch and you'd set it down and you'd have a wonderful

04:11.040 --> 04:15.080
new couch to abuse for the following year.

04:15.080 --> 04:19.180
Now one of the things I did during all these years of slacking in Madison was I was writing

04:19.180 --> 04:24.480
jokes for The Onion and to my great surprise that eventually turned into a career.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.440
And no one could have been more surprised about it than me, believe me.

04:28.440 --> 04:32.200
And I ended up moving to New York and for the first time I had money, so I was incredibly

04:32.200 --> 04:37.560
excited because I was not only going to be able to live this life of slack, but I was

04:37.560 --> 04:40.520
going to be able to live it in style.

04:40.520 --> 04:47.520
And I set up this wonderful apartment in Brooklyn, this nice living room and I filled it with

04:47.960 --> 04:48.880
seating.

04:48.880 --> 04:55.000
I bought a surround sound home theater and I got a DVD player for it.

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
I got a big TV and I got a fantastic number for a great connection with a top notch weed

05:02.320 --> 05:07.320
delivery service.

05:07.320 --> 05:12.680
And the best thing is I bought this fantastic, it was the couch of my dreams at this vintage

05:13.000 --> 05:13.200
store.

05:13.200 --> 05:20.560
I spent $500 on it, only couch I ever spent money on in my life.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.920
And I was so looking forward to all the wonderful times I was going to have with all these great

05:23.920 --> 05:25.840
new friends I was going to make in New York.

05:25.840 --> 05:31.280
But what I didn't understand was that New York is not like Madison.

05:31.280 --> 05:38.280
It's not a living room based town.

05:38.560 --> 05:44.120
Because all of the Lower East Side downtown Bohemians that I was wanting to hang out with,

05:44.120 --> 05:47.080
they don't have living rooms.

05:47.080 --> 05:52.240
They have a box with a bed and a refrigerator and a toilet and a shower and a sink and that's

05:52.240 --> 05:53.600
where they live.

05:53.600 --> 05:58.800
And so in lieu of living rooms, they hang out in bars and restaurants.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.040
And for that reason, it's also not a marijuana town, it's an alcohol town.

06:02.040 --> 06:06.600
So I've had to learn to drink and I'm getting pretty good at it to be honest.

06:06.600 --> 06:13.600
But none of those things really matter if, like me, you live in Brooklyn, but people

06:14.160 --> 06:16.920
from Manhattan won't go to Brooklyn.

06:16.920 --> 06:21.440
Because it's a 20 minute ride on the train and they're busy spending 40 to 80 minutes

06:21.440 --> 06:25.420
waiting to get into the cool restaurant or bar.

06:25.420 --> 06:30.740
So the upshot of all this is I spend about the next five years of my life in the ultimate

06:30.740 --> 06:37.020
slack pad I've created, surrounded by empty seats, alone, playing video games, watching

06:37.020 --> 06:42.100
DVDs, by myself.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.580
Surrounded by empty seating.

06:44.580 --> 06:50.580
And what's worse is that my DVD player even mocks me because whenever you hit stop a screen

06:50.580 --> 06:57.580
saver comes on with their consumer entertainment home theater slogan that says everyone's invited.

06:58.460 --> 07:02.300
Everyone's invited.

07:02.300 --> 07:09.300
Every day, everyone's invited, but you're here by yourself, aren't you?

07:10.740 --> 07:17.740
Over the years, the combined effects of A, gravity, B, time, and C, my ass on this couch,

07:18.780 --> 07:21.900
literally destroy my dream couch.

07:21.900 --> 07:26.940
The part of the couch where my ass is centered has collapsed completely.

07:26.940 --> 07:32.900
There's like springs and metal falling out the bottom, stuffing is falling out the bottom.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.740
There's just a hole where my ass is.

07:35.740 --> 07:41.900
I have to fill it up with pillows and blankets and put a board over it just to continue to

07:41.900 --> 07:48.900
lay on it.

07:50.180 --> 07:55.260
At this point in this story, I'm sure that those of you in the audience with even a remote

07:55.300 --> 08:00.860
sense of insight into the human condition are probably thinking to yourself, well, you

08:00.860 --> 08:04.900
know, these stories are all kind of cute anecdotes and they're a little bit funny, but I have

08:04.900 --> 08:08.500
another interpretation of everything this man on stage is saying and it sounds kind

08:08.500 --> 08:13.220
of to me like he's describing the behavior of someone who is, not to put too fine a point

08:13.220 --> 08:16.740
on it, clinically depressed.

08:16.740 --> 08:19.140
And you would be right.

08:19.140 --> 08:23.900
I happen to have been clinically depressed pretty much my entire adult life, which brings

08:23.900 --> 08:27.620
us back to why I was sitting in my shrink's office in the first place telling him about

08:27.620 --> 08:29.660
this horrible experience.

08:29.660 --> 08:31.300
So he says, tell me about it.

08:31.300 --> 08:37.380
I say, I'm laying on the couch and it was one of those days when you've run out of all

08:37.380 --> 08:39.460
the distractions available in the living room.

08:39.460 --> 08:46.460
Like I had watched all the DVDs, I had finished all the video games, I had masturbated to

08:46.700 --> 08:53.700
all of the available pornography, I had smoked all the drugs, there was nothing left.

08:53.940 --> 09:00.940
And I had a moment of zen stillness and clarity where I was face to face with myself.

09:01.340 --> 09:08.340
And I looked in myself and I saw this horrific, nightmarish void of nothingness.

09:09.880 --> 09:16.880
It was just this swirling vortex of empty zero.

09:16.980 --> 09:18.340
There was nothing there.

09:18.340 --> 09:22.320
I felt like I had no future, no past, no options, no hope.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.720
Like there was nothing to believe in.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.880
And at this point my shrink cuts me off and he says, Todd, Todd, wait, wait, hold on.

09:29.880 --> 09:34.160
Right now I'm hearing a lot of negativity from you.

09:34.160 --> 09:41.160
I mean, you're just describing a horrible descent into nihilism.

09:42.240 --> 09:46.000
And I give him this look like, well, duh, you know, and I say, yeah, the reason you're

09:46.000 --> 09:50.280
hearing that is because that's what I'm telling you.

09:50.320 --> 09:54.040
And he says, well, Todd, but that's very serious.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.240
Nihilism is a terrible place to end up.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.880
Bad things happen to people that go there.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.720
You can drown in that shit.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.840
So I say, well, let me tell you, do I hear a cell phone?

10:05.840 --> 10:07.440
Is that what that is?

10:07.440 --> 10:12.280
So I tell him, maybe someone's just giving me a little hip hop background to this.

10:12.280 --> 10:17.240
So I tell him, well, let me finish the story.

10:17.240 --> 10:20.640
Have you ever been so depressed that you just can't get out of bed or you just can't

10:20.640 --> 10:26.120
get out of your chair and you just end up relying on whatever's in arm's reach of you,

10:26.120 --> 10:27.880
you know?

10:27.880 --> 10:33.120
And so I'm sort of groping around the couch just looking for something, anything to distract

10:33.120 --> 10:36.380
me from this horrible emptiness that I'm experiencing.

10:36.380 --> 10:40.240
And I reach under the couch and I find this old paperback book that has been kicked under

10:40.240 --> 10:43.440
there probably a couple months earlier and I pull it out and it's the ultimate perfect

10:43.440 --> 10:46.840
book for lifting someone out of their own personal hell.

10:46.840 --> 10:57.400
Happens to be, swear to God this is true, not making this up, Dante's Inferno.

10:57.400 --> 11:03.000
So I'm like, I obviously cannot handle reading Dante's Inferno right now.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.200
But lacking anything else to do, I decide I'm going to read the foreword.

11:06.200 --> 11:13.280
So the foreword is written by some scholar of medieval Italian epic poetry or whatever.

11:13.280 --> 11:18.360
And I start reading it and I say to my doc, as I was reading it, I learned a new word.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.120
He says, what was it?

11:20.120 --> 11:23.760
And I said, well, the word is acedia.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.280
I'd never heard of this word before.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.000
And he says, what does it mean?

11:28.000 --> 11:34.720
I said, well, it was the medieval Catholic's word for the profound sense of emptiness that

11:34.720 --> 11:38.040
comes from not believing in anything.

11:38.040 --> 11:45.840
They saw it as a sin and specifically the sin of the failure, they defined it as the

11:45.840 --> 11:48.480
failure to pursue God.

11:48.480 --> 11:57.360
In other words, a lack of making the effort necessary to seek out the joy of God or more

11:57.360 --> 12:00.280
generally of creation.

12:00.280 --> 12:06.160
And it was considered so dangerous that they actually numbered it among the seven deadly

12:06.160 --> 12:08.480
sins, acedia.

12:08.480 --> 12:12.920
And by the way, I don't know if it's actually pronounced acedia because I'm a college dropout.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.440
I don't know how to pronounce ancient Latin.

12:15.440 --> 12:18.800
Granted, I knew I was going to be speaking in front of a couple hundred people.

12:18.800 --> 12:29.200
I probably could have Googled it and figured out the pronunciation, but I was too lazy.

12:29.200 --> 12:35.760
And at this point, I can tell that my shrink is a little uncomfortable with how the conversation

12:35.760 --> 12:38.960
is going because he doesn't like talking about sin.

12:38.960 --> 12:45.720
He doesn't like sin doctrine based modes of behavioral modification because he's a shrink.

12:45.720 --> 12:50.680
And shrinks are always against thinking about things in terms of sin because sin is always

12:50.680 --> 12:51.680
about guilt.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.900
And a shrink's job is to get people to get over guilt.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.520
So he's kind of trying to change the subject.

12:56.520 --> 13:04.100
But what I say to him is the amazing thing about this is that in modern times, it's usually

13:04.100 --> 13:16.020
translated or mistranslated, if you will, as sloth because it involves a lack of effort.

13:16.020 --> 13:21.820
But the idea is, you know, when we hear sloth now, I mean, it just seems like laziness.

13:21.820 --> 13:22.860
It's not that big of a sin.

13:22.860 --> 13:25.020
It's not deadly.

13:25.020 --> 13:27.500
But they were talking about something far more serious.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.300
They were talking about a deep existential despair.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.300
Thanks.

13:33.300 --> 13:44.780
And I realized as I was talking to him that if I'm guilty of acedia, then so is our whole

13:44.780 --> 13:50.240
consumer entertainment prozac taken depressed out of their mind nation.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.140
And I figured there's two ways of looking at it.

13:52.140 --> 13:58.900
Either we should be very grateful that ancient Catholic doctrine doesn't still dominate the

13:59.900 --> 14:04.380
because if so, then me and the whole nation are all just guilty, unredeemable sinners

14:04.380 --> 14:06.100
and can be written off.

14:06.100 --> 14:09.300
But the second way of looking at it is perhaps a little more productive is that this was

14:09.300 --> 14:15.180
a way of looking at my depression that didn't involve me being a helpless victim of a sickness

14:15.180 --> 14:21.820
defined by a condition and that I might have some degree of personal responsibility for

14:21.820 --> 14:24.740
my own state of mind.

14:24.780 --> 14:29.860
So my shrink looks at me and he doesn't say anything for a very long time because he doesn't

14:29.860 --> 14:31.220
like how the conversation's going.

14:31.220 --> 14:32.460
But on the other hand, he's a smart guy.

14:32.460 --> 14:34.860
So he's thinking very, very intently.

14:34.860 --> 14:40.920
And finally, he looks up at me and he says, that's very interesting.

14:40.920 --> 14:44.300
What are you going to do about it?

14:44.300 --> 14:51.700
And I look back at him and I say, hmm, thank you.

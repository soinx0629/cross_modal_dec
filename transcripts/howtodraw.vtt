00:00.000 --> 00:08.120
Where I grew up in the South, there was a right way to do things and a wrong way to

00:08.120 --> 00:10.400
do things.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.440
And the right way was to do what your family and society thought you should do.

00:15.440 --> 00:19.560
And the wrong way was to do something different.

00:19.560 --> 00:23.000
By age 30, I'd done most everything I was supposed to do.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.120
I'd overachieved in high school.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.720
I attended a prestigious college in the South.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.960
I had a good job, and I'd married well within the childbearing age.

00:32.960 --> 00:39.880
We'd married at my insistence, of course, but neither one of us was fully on board.

00:39.880 --> 00:45.320
So except for moving up north to Boston, which caused my family to collectively take to their

00:45.320 --> 00:50.840
beds, I was on track with what we thought my life should look like, but I wasn't happy,

00:50.840 --> 00:53.600
and I thought it was my career.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.880
In my family, I was expected to go into business.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.640
I'd been in public relations for seven years, but I didn't like the work anymore.

01:00.640 --> 01:05.160
I mean, I was good at it, but I was tired of working with clients, and plus I was working

01:05.160 --> 01:12.480
with companies like retail banking, traffic reporting, hazardous waste recycling, nothing

01:12.480 --> 01:15.680
that really blew my skirt up.

01:15.680 --> 01:20.560
So I quit my full-time job, and I started consulting, and I started taking classes to

01:20.560 --> 01:23.200
figure out what else I could do for a living.

01:23.200 --> 01:28.080
Now, the only criterion for the classes was that the instructors and students could not

01:28.080 --> 01:31.480
know or care what the Financial Times was.

01:31.480 --> 01:35.600
I took needlepoint, directing, French.

01:35.600 --> 01:39.920
I found this brochure for the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and I thought,

01:39.920 --> 01:42.120
oh, well, this looks interesting.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.760
And I went to the school, and I talked to the continuing education director, and I asked

01:45.760 --> 01:51.960
him which class he thought I should take, and he said, you need to take art as process.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.720
We take burnout executives in that class all the time.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.040
I sign up.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.200
It's my first day of art school.

02:01.200 --> 02:08.080
I do my best to look artsy, to fit in, but even though I am not wearing pearls, they

02:08.080 --> 02:14.160
are still emblazoned on my chest.

02:14.160 --> 02:20.320
And our instructor, Rhoda, introduces herself, and she says, there is no right way to make

02:20.320 --> 02:24.040
art, and there is no wrong way to make art.

02:24.040 --> 02:29.160
Now this makes me extremely nervous, because I have been raised that there is a right way

02:29.160 --> 02:33.200
and a wrong way to do most everything.

02:33.200 --> 02:38.840
And then she says, the class will focus on process, the process of art making, not the

02:38.840 --> 02:40.920
end result.

02:40.920 --> 02:45.640
Now this makes me even more nervous, because I have been raised to focus on results, and

02:45.640 --> 02:49.880
not just any results, but the best results.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.040
And there are no grades.

02:53.040 --> 02:57.040
Things careen out of control.

02:57.040 --> 03:01.280
If there are no grades, how will I know if I'm overachieving?

03:01.280 --> 03:05.840
I need to know that I'm overachieving.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.720
We start with the basics, and in my entire life, I have never held a stick of charcoal

03:10.720 --> 03:13.200
in my hand, and it feels good.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.920
And I survive the first week of simple art exercises, and I enjoy myself.

03:17.960 --> 03:22.640
And the next week, Bob, one of the three instructors, says, today we're going to do gesture drawings,

03:22.640 --> 03:28.320
very fast drawings, about 45 second poses, and we're going to draw the energy and the

03:28.320 --> 03:31.280
movement and the essence of the figure.

03:31.280 --> 03:36.240
And I am thinking, what the heck is essence, and how the heck do you draw it?

03:36.240 --> 03:39.960
And a man, the artist's model, starts to undress.

03:39.960 --> 03:45.200
And I say, well that's okay, you've seen a naked man before, you've even had sex with

03:45.200 --> 03:47.560
a naked man before.

03:47.560 --> 03:56.400
Your problem is, you don't know how to draw this naked man's essence.

03:56.400 --> 04:01.360
And everybody else apparently does know how to draw his essence, as they're all busily

04:01.360 --> 04:06.400
getting out their easels and knowingly getting out sheets of paper and charcoal and other

04:06.400 --> 04:09.360
drawing mediums with which they excel.

04:09.360 --> 04:14.720
And I'm just standing there like the proverbial deer in headlights, and I begin to watch and

04:14.720 --> 04:20.840
imitate because I am clueless but competitive.

04:20.840 --> 04:26.080
And so I ask Judy, who is standing next to me and also a mature student, I say, Judy,

04:26.080 --> 04:27.920
what are these supposed to look like?

04:27.920 --> 04:31.960
Because of course I think there's only one right way to do this, and we're all going

04:31.960 --> 04:33.880
to draw the same image.

04:33.880 --> 04:40.640
And she looks at me bewildered and says, they're all going to look different.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.120
I'm paralyzed.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.480
What is mine supposed to look like?

04:45.480 --> 04:50.560
Can't I just do a slide presentation for your board of directors, maybe conduct a communications

04:50.560 --> 04:54.080
audit, assess your customer service capabilities?

04:54.080 --> 04:59.640
These are things I know how to do, things in which I excel, and I like to excel, and

04:59.640 --> 05:04.920
there is no way I'm going to excel drawing this naked man's essence.

05:04.920 --> 05:09.480
And I'm about to cry, and then the competitive side of me kicks in and says, well just snap

05:09.480 --> 05:11.760
out of it, you big wimp, and do something.

05:11.760 --> 05:16.320
So I start making these hopeless stick figures every 45 seconds, because that's how fast

05:16.320 --> 05:21.960
the poses are every 45 seconds, and every 45 seconds I feel like a total failure, which

05:21.960 --> 05:29.000
is a lot of times in one hour, it's 80.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.920
And the shame is enormous, and I'm mortified at how inept I am, and I'm beating myself

05:34.920 --> 05:40.760
up for ever trying anything different, for even attempting anything new, and I'm in literal

05:40.760 --> 05:46.040
physical pain, I am so far out of my comfort level, I mean I actually hurt.

05:46.040 --> 05:52.360
And I'm about to cry again, and that's when Bob comes over and shows me what amazing teachers

05:52.360 --> 05:58.080
can do, I don't even know what he says, all I know is he talks me off the ledge and breaks

05:58.080 --> 06:02.640
the vice grip that has a hold of me, and I start to draw.

06:02.640 --> 06:07.560
At the end of class, Bob picks one of my gesture drawings to put up on the wall with a bunch

06:07.560 --> 06:11.080
of other student drawings so we can discuss them.

06:11.080 --> 06:16.400
No one laughs at me or my drawing, it actually holds its own.

06:16.400 --> 06:24.440
I have drawn a naked man, and I feel like I can do anything, but things at home start

06:24.440 --> 06:26.960
to get a little tricky.

06:26.960 --> 06:31.760
My husband is an art director, one of the reasons why I married him, I loved being with

06:31.760 --> 06:35.960
somebody artsy, he seemed so exotic and interesting.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
He was the creative one, and I was the business one.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.480
But when I started going to art school, all the roles were off, the balance of power completely

06:44.480 --> 06:46.740
out of sync.

06:46.740 --> 06:51.440
So class continues for the next six weeks, and it's an emotional rollercoaster, I mean

06:51.440 --> 06:55.840
my thinking is shifting and breaking apart and I cry every day.

06:55.840 --> 07:00.560
And my final assignment is a wall installation, which is a term I didn't even know existed

07:00.560 --> 07:02.480
six weeks before.

07:02.480 --> 07:07.320
And it includes these three wall sculptures, these sculptures made out of the New York

07:07.320 --> 07:12.760
Times business sections and the Wall Street Journal, all painted black.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.840
And they're bound in these really tight boxes.

07:15.840 --> 07:21.560
And each piece gets progressively more undone until the final piece explodes.

07:21.560 --> 07:26.640
And Bob, the instructor that talked to me off the ledge, sees it, and he says, Trisha,

07:26.640 --> 07:31.720
you know, you really ought to apply to the museum school.

07:31.720 --> 07:35.840
Well, this thought had never occurred to me before, I mean, in the back of my mind, I'm

07:35.840 --> 07:39.800
going to end up in business school, that this is a once in a lifetime event until I go back

07:39.800 --> 07:46.800
to my normal life, and I'm highly suspicious, and then it occurs to me what's happening.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.600
He's hitting on me.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.040
I have no artistic talent at all.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.320
He's just flattering me until he can get lucky.

07:56.320 --> 08:00.720
And this theory sticks until I find out he's been in a committed relationship for the past

08:00.720 --> 08:05.520
18 years with his boyfriend.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.560
So then I start thinking of other reasons why they may want me to apply.

08:09.560 --> 08:13.620
Maybe they think I have a lot of money and I'll be a big donor, because I was working

08:13.620 --> 08:17.560
at Harvard Business School at the time, or maybe they think I know people who will be

08:17.560 --> 08:18.860
big donors.

08:18.860 --> 08:24.640
And so while I'm using all of my creative energy trying to imagine why I'm not creative,

08:24.960 --> 08:29.040
Charles, one of the instructors, comes up to me and says, Trisha, you really ought to

08:29.040 --> 08:30.760
apply to the museum school.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.600
I mean, you know you're an artist.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.800
You're one of us.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.480
Panic begins to set in.

08:37.480 --> 08:43.080
And I enroll in art school as a part-time student, but I'm still consulting.

08:43.080 --> 08:49.680
And I'm both excited and traumatized, because for the first time in my life, I am not following

08:49.680 --> 08:51.680
the rules.

08:51.720 --> 08:59.200
And I say to my dear friend Sarah, who's also a Southerner, I say, Sarah, I am so afraid

08:59.200 --> 09:02.520
of being different than everybody else.

09:02.520 --> 09:09.200
And she says, oh, Trisha, I'm so afraid of being just like everybody else.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.320
And my marriage begins to explode.

09:12.320 --> 09:17.720
And part of the reason is I'm not supposed to excel beyond men, definitely not beyond

09:17.720 --> 09:18.720
my husband.

09:18.760 --> 09:23.480
I had places I wanted to go, and he just wasn't moving fast enough.

09:23.480 --> 09:28.000
I kept pushing him to move faster so I could move forward.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
And one day, he just says to me, Trisha, you just want me to go places I don't want to

09:34.000 --> 09:36.760
go.

09:36.760 --> 09:41.760
At art school, since we don't have grades, we have review boards.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.700
And at the end of each semester, we put up all the work we've done, and two instructors

09:45.700 --> 09:49.540
and several students review the work, give us feedback, and guide us on our creative

09:49.540 --> 09:50.780
path.

09:50.780 --> 09:55.100
And I'm driving to my review board in the Jeep I've purchased for the yet-to-be-conceived

09:55.100 --> 09:57.620
children I assume I'll have.

09:57.620 --> 10:00.780
But instead, it's piled high with artwork.

10:00.780 --> 10:06.940
And at my review board, one of the students writes this on his review board sheet.

10:06.940 --> 10:11.220
You seem to be a little frantic.

10:11.220 --> 10:12.220
Very perceptive.

10:12.580 --> 10:16.020
It has something to do with control.

10:16.020 --> 10:18.220
It's okay to let go.

10:18.220 --> 10:21.980
You're expecting this to be black or white, but the process won't allow that.

10:21.980 --> 10:25.100
You've got to let go.

10:25.100 --> 10:30.380
I'm not sure if he's talking about my artwork or my marriage.

10:30.380 --> 10:35.060
My husband and I separate, and a dear friend of mine says, you know, Trisha, I love my

10:35.060 --> 10:40.700
husband and I love my children, but I never thought I had options.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.780
You have options.

10:42.780 --> 10:48.580
And she's right, because even though my life is blowing apart, or maybe because it is,

10:48.580 --> 10:52.920
I begin to really find my voice and step into my artwork.

10:52.920 --> 10:58.140
My mother sees it and says, why is it so dark?

10:58.140 --> 11:04.860
Why aren't there any heads?

11:04.860 --> 11:10.380
It's getting harder and harder to do my consulting work, and even though I'm getting paid a firehose

11:10.380 --> 11:15.260
of cash, I know that if I do this work for much longer, I'm going to die.

11:15.260 --> 11:19.060
Slowly, but I'm going to die.

11:19.060 --> 11:23.060
And I realize I'm not just in the wrong job or the wrong marriage.

11:23.060 --> 11:25.260
I'm in the wrong life.

11:25.260 --> 11:30.020
I don't want to do what other people want me to do or think I should do anymore.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.060
All I want is to make art.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.460
I'm an artist.

11:34.460 --> 11:42.900
And the week we separate, they tear down my family home of 25 years and my Jeep gets stolen.

11:42.900 --> 11:48.580
I have this keychain with three keys on it, one to the house I don't live in anymore,

11:48.580 --> 11:54.420
one to my family home that's been torn down, and one to my Jeep that's been stolen.

11:54.420 --> 11:58.500
God is banging on my hood.

11:58.500 --> 12:03.060
So I toss the keys, head to art school, and join my tribe.

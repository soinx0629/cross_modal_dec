1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
There are some scientists who say that the universe

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,600
that we inhabit is not the only universe there is.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,640
There are alternate universes.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,640
They say that these universes arise

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,720
from the subatomic realm of quantum physics.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,240
Here's how they say it works.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,680
Every time a quantum event happens,

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,560
it produces all of its possible results.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,480
This is like saying if you flip a coin,

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,160
it comes up heads, but it also comes up tails.

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,840
Since those two results are mutually exclusive,

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,600
the flipping of the coin splits the universe

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,120
into two alternate universes, the heads universe

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,800
and the tails universe.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,760
And since quantum events are happening all the time,

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,400
it means that alternate universes

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,840
are bubbling up continually.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,280
They're always being created, splitting off from ours.

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,800
And these alternate universes are real.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,880
They're not just figments of the imagination.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,840
They're complete, whole, real things.

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,080
I know this is true because I experienced

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,460
an alternate universe.

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,400
I was driving in my Volkswagen van

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,080
up to a Tai Chi camp in upstate New York

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,320
a couple of summers ago.

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,560
I bought the Volkswagen van when I'd quit my job

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,100
a few years previously.

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,000
I bought the van because I quit the job

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,920
as a custom database application engineer.

31
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,000
This was not a job that I really had intended to become.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,580
When I was a kid, that's not what I thought

33
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,820
I was going to be.

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,520
It's just sort of the job I happened into

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,060
and I always thought of it as the work I was doing

36
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,180
before I was going to find my real work.

37
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,360
But when I got close to about 40,

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,800
I suddenly thought, oh my God, this could be it.

39
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,160
This could be what I end up doing.

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,960
This could be on my tombstone.

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,640
Tom Weiser, custom database application engineer,

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,560
wrote well-optimized queries.

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,580
Many customers satisfied.

44
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,120
And I thought, no, that can't be it.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,320
That can't be all there is.

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,160
And I quit the job without really knowing

47
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,440
what I was going to do next.

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,320
And I knew that what I should do was to take my skill set

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,480
and to make a lateral move to a career path

50
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,080
that was more appropriate.

51
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,340
But I really didn't want to do that.

52
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,520
I didn't want to be so logical.

53
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,680
I actually wanted something more magic.

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,360
I wanted to be like the guy in the fairy tale

55
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,120
that trades the cow for the magic beans.

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,880
And I know that that's a bad deal.

57
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,000
I know that the cow's a better investment.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,800
The cow's going to pay off in the long term.

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,520
But if the magic beans work out,

60
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,280
you're in a whole new story.

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
So I quit the job and I bought

62
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,560
a Volkswagen pop-top camper van.

63
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,240
And I drove around country and what I thought is, okay,

64
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,140
I'm not going to make a lateral move.

65
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,160
I am going to drive around the country

66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,840
and I'm going to open myself up to whatever may come.

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,240
And then what I'm going to do is going to arise organically.

68
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,080
I'm going to find my next path there

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
by the side of the road in Arizona.

70
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,920
I'm going to pick it up and bring it back to New York.

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,360
So I drove around the country, 25,000 miles, eight months.

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,640
And when I got back to New York, I had no clue.

73
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,440
I really didn't know and it left me very vulnerable

74
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,800
to the New York question.

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,640
The first question anybody asked, which is,

76
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,180
so, what do you do?

77
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,180
I didn't know.

78
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,740
I didn't have a good answer and it made me feel really embarrassed

79
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,420
because everybody knows what they do.

80
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,060
Everybody does and I thought I should too.

81
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,100
So when I was driving the Volkswagen van up to Tai Chi Camp

82
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,660
the other summer, I felt very relieved

83
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,060
because in camp, I know what I do.

84
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,260
I do the camp thing.

85
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
I do what's at camp.

86
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,500
And I don't know if you know this,

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,900
but there are a lot of camps for adults that are out there.

88
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,580
I found them when I was driving around the country.

89
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,060
There are Tai Chi camps and yoga camps

90
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,740
and bird watching camps.

91
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,940
There's even a camp where you can dress up in armor

92
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,020
and joust.

93
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,340
All the things that give us joy

94
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,940
and that we tend to demean with the name hobby,

95
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,540
those are the things that are celebrated in camp.

96
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,060
And when people go to camp, they are so lit up.

97
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,020
They are finally getting to do that thing,

98
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,860
the thing they love.

99
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,180
It's like, yes, I finally get to joust.

100
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,940
I don't have time for that anymore.

101
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,780
Really.

102
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,460
So I was going up to camp and feeling pretty good about it.

103
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,460
And I decided on the way, I would stop into Ithaca.

104
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,420
I'd heard that it was kind of a neat town.

105
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,060
So I pulled off the highway into Ithaca

106
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,460
and it's on the southern shore of Lake Cayuga.

107
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,980
There's flatland and these hills

108
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,180
and it has a very particular microclimate there

109
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,980
which allows hippies to survive.

110
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,140
All the stores have names like it takes a village

111
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,540
or hemp unlimited.

112
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,860
And the children are all completely multi-ethnic

113
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,900
and only wear cloth, organic diapers.

114
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,980
It was really something.

115
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,180
I drove around like sort of like Disney hippie land,

116
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,020
just watching it.

117
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,420
And then I drove up the hill up toward Cornell

118
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,820
which has these stately buildings on the hilltop.

119
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
And as I drove onto the campus,

120
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,780
I had this stabbing sensation

121
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,860
and I suddenly was pierced with a vision

122
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,580
of an alternate universe, my alternate life.

123
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,260
I thought, oh my God, I was supposed to go to Cornell.

124
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,860
If I had gone to Cornell,

125
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,180
I would have studied animal behavior.

126
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,500
And right now I'd be a professor of evolutionary biology.

127
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,060
I'm a professor of evolutionary biology

128
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,180
and I've got a wife.

129
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,940
She's got dark hair.

130
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,660
She's really smart.

131
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,580
And I'm a professor with a wife and we've got two kids.

132
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,820
They like to sing.

133
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,900
It was this completely realized vision

134
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,900
of this alternate life and it looked so good.

135
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,740
Alternate Ithaca, Tom, he'd made these great choices.

136
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,140
It was really working out.

137
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,300
And I drove around in a kind of a wash of nostalgia

138
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,500
for this life that I hadn't had.

139
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,820
It's like, wow, there's the human ecology center.

140
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,540
I did all my grad work there.

141
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,940
And there was this funky cottage that I used to live in

142
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,620
when I had six roommates and we had a chore wheel

143
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,340
and ate brown rice.

144
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,700
And there was these gorges that we used to do drum circles

145
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,300
and songs to the goddess.

146
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,260
And there was this woman that looked just like my wife

147
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,460
would have looked when I would have met her.

148
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,980
I was overwhelmed by it.

149
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,140
I couldn't stand to stay there any longer.

150
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,740
I drove off the campus.

151
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,900
I fled Ithaca and flew to Tai Chi Camp.

152
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,100
But alternate Ithaca, Tom, came with me.

153
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,860
Now at camps, I tend to really have a good time.

154
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,020
I laugh a lot, I joke a lot, especially in Tai Chi Camp

155
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,020
but the residents are kind of serious and slow moving.

156
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,740
I can't help but kind of tease them.

157
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,540
And in this particular camp,

158
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,060
the teacher said that we were going to be meditating

159
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,260
every morning from seven to eight.

160
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,940
And she was looking for a volunteer, someone, a musician

161
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,380
that would wander the hallways, playing an instrument

162
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,920
or singing to wake up the residents.

163
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,980
I'm not a morning person.

164
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,300
And so I thought, oh, so I have a choice here.

165
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,500
Either it's gonna be 6.30, I'll be lying in my bed,

166
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,980
really grumpy, while some asshole sings outside my door.

167
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,820
Or I could be the singing asshole.

168
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,180
For the rest of that week,

169
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,180
I was the singing asshole of the camp.

170
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,580
Every morning I would roam the hall singing lustily,

171
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,980
waking up all my fellow Tai Chi players.

172
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,340
And the people there saw me laughing and singing

173
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,420
and they said, Tom, it's really great to have you here.

174
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,260
You're so happy.

175
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,300
You're such a happy guy.

176
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,420
And I thought, yeah, you think I'm happy,

177
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,980
but you haven't seen alternate Ithaca Tom.

178
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,860
I've seen him.

179
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,340
He's happy.

180
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,260
And the fact that he was so much happier than me

181
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,940
was making me miserable.

182
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,540
And I kept looking at everybody else's life

183
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,260
and comparing myself to them.

184
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,140
And I remember having lunch with a woman

185
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,660
who were in her 60s and she was a calligrapher.

186
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,580
And she was about to have her first grandchild.

187
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,540
She was really excited.

188
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,300
And I thought, maybe calligraphy, that could be it.

189
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,860
And then there was this other guy

190
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,940
and he had studied Tai Chi when he was in his 20s

191
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,900
and now he was a sales rep at Dell.

192
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,180
And I thought, damn it, if I had studied Tai Chi in my 20s,

193
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,620
maybe I could be a sales rep at Dell now.

194
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,220
I've never wanted to be a sales rep,

195
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,500
but I was just getting carried away.

196
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,620
That feeling that I was in the wrong life,

197
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,900
I was in the wrong place, I couldn't shake it.

198
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,060
I really tried to absorb the lesson of Tai Chi,

199
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,700
which is to be present, just relax,

200
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,660
accept what's coming to you and be present here.

201
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,300
But I thought, yeah, yeah, that would be easy.

202
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,660
It's so much easier to accept where you are

203
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,620
if only you're in the right place.

204
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,220
Eventually camp was over and I left.

205
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,460
I drove back to New York.

206
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,140
And as I was driving over the George Washington Bridge,

207
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,140
I could still hear alternate Ithaca Tom.

208
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,980
He was hanging around me, haunting me like a ghost.

209
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,500
And I thought, oh God, I need professional help.

210
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,900
So I made an appointment with the family psychic.

211
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,100
This is the guy that's done readings

212
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,940
for all of my siblings and my cousins.

213
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,500
And I went to see him and he's an astrologer.

214
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,820
So he did out my chart.

215
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,620
And this time he was very interested

216
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,660
in this polarity that he saw.

217
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,340
He said, you have Saturn in the mid heaven.

218
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,340
And this marks you as a person

219
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,220
who could be very organizational.

220
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,140
The organizational man, the hierarchical one,

221
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,740
the corporate guy, the dad, the provider,

222
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,700
not particularly sexy, but a straight up guy.

223
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,540
On the other hand, there's Pisces and the sun.

224
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,460
And they're squared with each other.

225
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,300
You can't resolve them.

226
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,340
Piscean, the dreamer, the mystic,

227
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,940
the guy that's the artist never quite pinned down,

228
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,340
never quite in a relationship.

229
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,300
And you have to balance these two.

230
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,940
You have to choose one or the other.

231
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,660
And normally I love to hear this kind of thing.

232
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,620
This is the great thing about going to a psychic

233
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,380
is that for an hour they just talk about me.

234
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,660
It's so interesting.

235
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,060
But this time I was so caught up with alternate Ithaca time,

236
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,900
I couldn't really appreciate it all.

237
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,060
So I just blurted out what had happened to me.

238
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,820
And I asked him, what does this mean?

239
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,260
And the psychic said, wow, this represents

240
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,180
a fundamental choice that you've made in your life.

241
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,780
You could have been the hierarchical guy,

242
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,180
but you chose to be the Piscean.

243
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,580
If you had decided to be an academic,

244
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,620
you would have been very successful.

245
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,460
There's no doubt that the youth

246
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,700
There's no doubt that the university structure

247
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,180
would have raised you up.

248
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,020
You probably would be married, have kids.

249
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,940
And I thought, oh shit, alternate Ithaca time

250
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,740
made the right choices.

251
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,020
But the psychic said, if you had become an academic,

252
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,940
your wife would have had an affair with your brother

253
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,020
or your best friend.

254
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,860
Alternate Ithaca time is crushed.

255
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,900
He's just found out that his wife is having an affair

256
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,940
with his research partner.

257
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,340
This is the guy he's been working with for 15 years.

258
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,420
It's a long-term affair.

259
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,780
They're moving in together.

260
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,780
She's taking the kids.

261
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,140
He's completely crushed.

262
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,620
Poor alternate Ithaca time.

263
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,980
He starts drinking.

264
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,020
He can't keep his lecture notes together.

265
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,500
He can't keep his research together.

266
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,700
He's coming up for tenure and it's all falling apart.

267
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,980
And in the midst of his turmoil,

268
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,740
he's suddenly pierced by this vision of himself

269
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,500
driving a Volkswagen van.

270
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,220
He's off to camp.

271
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,140
It's a Tai Chi camp.

272
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,740
He's not married.

273
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,900
He doesn't have kids.

274
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,500
He doesn't even have a job.

275
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,260
He's completely free.

276
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,780
It looks so good.

277
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,380
This image, it pierces him to his heart.

278
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,380
Begins to hang around him and haunt him

279
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,100
like a hungry ghost.

280
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,140
Thank you.

281
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,980
Thank you.

282
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,820
Thank you.

283
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,660
Thank you.

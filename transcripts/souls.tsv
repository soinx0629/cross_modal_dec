0	8880	So a lot of people are raised with a religion, and I'm one of those people that was raised
8880	10520	with two.
10520	12160	There was our official religion.
12160	18080	My family is, and I was at the time, conservative evangelical Christians.
18080	27280	But then there was our unofficial faith and hope we had in Mary Kay cosmetics.
27280	32680	Many of the women in my family had been Mary Kay beauty consultants since I was a child,
32680	40520	and I loved Jesus as long as I could remember, but that Mary Kay thing, I was hoping to dodge
40520	42800	that bullet.
42800	45400	I was this brainy grunge girl from Boulder County.
45400	49680	I wore hemp jewelry and clothes from the Salvation Army.
49680	55760	I had moral objections to wearing makeup, and when I got a scholarship to go out of
55760	59520	state for college, I thought I'd made my big escape.
59520	66480	But my last visit home, I listened to one recruiting tape too many, and the logic and
66480	71960	reason finally got to me, and I signed the dotted line, and I started my business as
71960	74680	a Mary Kay beauty consultant.
74680	79040	Now on paper, the business plan looks foolproof.
79040	83240	All you're supposed to need is to have one friend to host a party for you, where you
83240	88080	sell skin care and makeup to her friends, and then you're supposed to book two more
88080	91760	every time, so your date book is never empty.
91760	95000	But I could never book two more.
95000	98520	I used the script I thought I was fun to be with.
98520	104560	I don't know what the problem was, but luckily for me, there was like a hundred other ways
104560	109800	they trained us to get bookings, and one of these ways was to strike up seemingly natural
109800	113480	conversations with perfect strangers.
113480	117000	And we had a name for this.
117000	122800	We called this warm chatter.
122800	126800	And I thought, damn it, I am going to rock this.
126800	130280	I'm going to be the queen of warm chatter.
130280	135720	So what I'm about to tell you, I did this for a very long time, about two or three days
135720	138600	a week for two or three hours a day.
138600	143000	I would get dressed up in my business suit, and I'd put on all my makeup, and I'd pack
143000	147240	my bag full of samples, and I would drive to Target.
147240	150480	And in Target, I would get my red shopping cart, and I would pretend I was shopping for
150480	157360	items, but really, I was just hunting for women.
157360	162180	I was looking for women who looked cute or friendly or approachable.
162180	170100	When I found somebody like this, then I would just discreetly follow her through the store
170100	177580	until we could be together in an aisle alone.
177580	186420	And then I would appear to just be walking by normally, and I would slow down, and in
186420	191140	the most casual way possible, I would say these words that I had rehearsed a hundred
191140	192140	million times.
192140	197420	I would say, excuse me, can I ask you a quick question?
197420	202460	I'm Jen with Mary Kay, and we just came out with a new line of lip glosses, and I need
202460	204020	some women's opinions of it.
204020	207600	You know, I have some samples here in my bag.
207600	211420	Is there any reason why you wouldn't want to take one home and try it?
211420	212900	And this part was really important.
212900	215740	We are trained to smile and nod while we ask the question.
216380	218340	It has to do with the nonverbal communication.
218340	223900	In mirroring, it's very advanced.
223900	226780	And if she said yes, I'd give her the sample, I'd get her phone number.
226780	231140	When I called her back later to thank her, I would offer her a complimentary appointment
231140	232140	with me.
232140	234980	And I wouldn't mention that all my appointments were complimentary, because it just didn't
234980	237780	seem important.
237780	244660	So at the same time I was doing this for my career, my husband and I were also helping
244700	247420	to lead programs for our local church.
247420	250180	And this was the kind of church that was trying to be really hip and modern.
250180	256700	It met in a strip mall, and we had a rock band, a rock band leading worship up front.
256700	261100	The pastor was this 40-somethings British guy, and he really wanted to attract 20-somethings,
261100	262100	so we were a hot commodity.
262100	265100	We were right in the demographic.
265100	269780	And we started to get promoted up into higher and higher echelons of leadership.
269780	273460	So we were invited to the leadership team meeting and then the core leadership team
273460	274460	meeting.
275260	279980	And I still remember my first night at one of these meetings, and I don't know exactly
279980	286260	what I was expecting, but I think I'd always imagine them to be kind of soulful events.
286260	292500	And I was really dismayed to show up and discover it was this really tedious conversation about
292500	298340	branding and marketing and what the church's next advertising campaign was going to be.
298340	303020	So it didn't take too long before these two worlds, the church and Mary Kay, started to
303020	308420	look more and more similar.
308420	313420	They both had the lure, and Mary Kay was giving out free samples, but at the church we were
313420	316740	having free events to try and get people in the doors.
316740	322140	In both worlds, we were couching everything we did inside a conversation about service.
322140	327860	So Mary Kay's company tagline at the time was, changing women's lives, which if you
327860	334820	think about it, isn't that different from saving people's souls?
334820	337740	And we really believed it.
337740	342420	We really thought we were doing this, even though nobody's motives are that pure.
342420	346500	And in both worlds, I was being trained all the time to listen to people everywhere I
346500	351300	went for whatever was missing or not working about their life and offer what we had as
351300	353140	the solution.
353140	360100	So if you needed time or money or flexibility, Mary Kay might be perfect for you, but if
360100	364380	you're struggling with your marriage or you've had a recent loss, maybe you're questioning
364380	371780	the meaning of life, call me crazy, but have you considered maybe Jesus is the answer?
371780	377500	And soon I just started to feel like a 24-hour saleswoman, and it started to get confusing
378260	385260	I was wearing at which time until one day I was in Target with my little red cart, and
386380	392620	I saw this lovely-looking redhead who smiled so big when I smiled at her, and I started
392620	393980	into my script.
393980	397740	Excuse me, can I ask you a quick question?
397740	402520	Except this time it starts to sound kind of flat, like those pull-string dolls that sound
402520	405040	kind of wonky at the end.
405080	412080	And suddenly I was just thinking, does she need Mary Kay or does she need Jesus?
414600	418600	Does she need Mary Kay or does she need Jesus?
418600	427600	And I don't know which one I offered her, but she said no, because I was acting crazy.
428360	435360	And she turned and walked away, and I realized the problem with whenever you have something,
440480	445360	whether it's a religion or a business or anything else that you think is the right answer for
445360	450440	everybody, through that lens you can't help but look at everyone in the world as if they're
450440	456280	broken and need to be fixed, and I didn't want to do that anymore.
456280	461080	So I put my cart away at the front of the store and I drove home.
461080	467800	The next night was my weekly success meeting, and the director was up front telling us,
467800	471940	giving us all the information about the new lipstick formula and the changes that were
471940	475360	being made, and I started to look around the room at these women, and they were either
475360	480620	my friends who I recruited into it or my relatives who had recruited me into it, and I was thinking
480620	486000	about how devastating it would be when I quit, because I wasn't just rejecting everything
486000	492840	they stood for, but I was letting down my friends, I was bailing on them, and then my
492840	497280	relatives, the people who had recruited me, their income depended on me.
497280	503320	Their income, their status, all of our fortunes were tied in together.
503320	508600	And I thought, but is this really changing women's lives the way I hoped it would?
508600	514320	And the director started passing around mirrors and lipstick samples for us to try it ourselves,
514320	519240	and I thought, no, I don't think so anymore.
519240	525120	And a couple days later was the church leadership meeting, and the pastor was telling us that
525120	529120	the church's new mission statement needed to have five points, one for every finger
529120	532760	on the hand, so people could remember it.
532760	538320	And I started looking around this room and thinking about what they would think about
538320	540840	me when I quit.
540840	545200	They would think I was backsliding and falling off the wagon, but it was even worse than
545200	546200	that.
546200	549680	They would think I was going to hell, that my children were going to hell, and if I was
549680	552560	wrong, maybe they would be right.
552560	559520	And I thought, but is this really saving people's souls, this, all this that we're doing?
559520	563760	And the pastor interrupted to say that all five points needed to start with the same
563760	568320	letter.
568320	576880	And I thought, no, I don't think so anymore.
576880	584080	And so that was when I stopped trying to save the world, and I decided to save myself instead
584080	587160	from this life I didn't want anymore.
587160	589920	And it really cost me.
589920	592900	I lost my identity.
592900	594760	I lost belonging.
594800	601880	I lost the ability to ever be that certain or righteous about anything ever again.
601880	606480	And if you can imagine what it's like to lose a faith, and then imagine what it's like to
606480	611640	lose two at once, because even though Mary Kay was a business, it wasn't just that, it
611640	613960	was a way I thought the world worked.
613960	618520	It's a way I thought that we could all win and everybody could get what they needed.
618520	620160	It was really devastating.
620200	625120	I felt like I might not ever be able to trust myself again.
625120	630320	The last piece of our exit strategy was our move to New York.
630320	635480	We were going to get geographic distance, start fresh someplace else.
635480	639720	We landed in Brooklyn in a neighborhood called Park Slope.
639720	646400	And everywhere we went, people were either trying to recruit us into or warn us against
646440	648840	joining the Park Slope food co-op.
654000	662680	And it seemed so unobjectionable, you know?
662680	670400	Like who can argue against cheap, organic, environmentally friendly food, community run?
670400	676840	And part of me was really tempted, because I thought I can have my identity back.
676840	680720	Everyone will know I'm a good person.
680720	682960	And I can belong again.
682960	688040	But there was something about the way that the people we talked to were just so convinced
688040	695040	it was the right thing for everybody that felt creepily familiar.
695080	700400	And I thought, I know where that path leads.
700400	706960	So when one particularly zealous friend cornered me one day and said, are you going to join
706960	708120	or not?
708120	711080	Are you in or are you out?
711080	718880	I just took a deep breath and I looked her in the eyes and I said, sorry, I don't do
718880	721640	religions anymore.
721640	722640	Thank you.

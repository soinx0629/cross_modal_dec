WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.380
In all honesty, I'm going to start

00:01.380 --> 00:06.140
by admitting that I sometimes lie.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.060
Occasionally, I'll include a lie in a story

00:08.060 --> 00:11.420
I'm telling if I think it'll make the story better.

00:11.420 --> 00:13.340
I don't do it to protect the innocent,

00:13.340 --> 00:14.840
because I don't know any stories where

00:14.840 --> 00:17.300
the people in them are innocent.

00:17.300 --> 00:19.180
And I don't do it to be shocking either,

00:19.180 --> 00:23.020
though I admit to once telling a story where I exaggerated

00:23.020 --> 00:26.220
the length of my penis.

00:26.220 --> 00:29.020
In my own defense, I exaggerated down and not up.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.640
And I did it for the laugh.

00:32.640 --> 00:36.160
The story I'm telling you tonight does not have a lie in it,

00:36.160 --> 00:37.800
or many laughs for that matter.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.880
When I'm done telling you this story, you may think

00:39.880 --> 00:44.400
it's nothing but a lie, but I'd ask you to trust me on this.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.240
At the age of 19, I fell prey to a powerful and deeply

00:48.240 --> 00:50.400
corrupting influence.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.840
It dogged me for six years, costing me many a friend,

00:53.840 --> 00:57.520
and in the process bringing my family to ruin.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.460
It crippled me to such an extent that I

00:59.460 --> 01:03.740
have spent the intervening 15 years recovering from it.

01:03.740 --> 01:05.420
The influence I speak of is hope.

01:09.220 --> 01:10.500
Now, you should know at the get go,

01:10.500 --> 01:12.860
there's nothing in my childhood to suggest

01:12.860 --> 01:16.220
I might find myself on such a wayward path as that.

01:16.220 --> 01:18.100
My parents loved me terribly.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.500
They taught me right from wrong.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.500
They taught me to be courageous in the face of bullies.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.960
They taught me patience and forgiveness.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.100
They taught me that love would see you

01:28.100 --> 01:31.220
through any misfortune.

01:31.220 --> 01:33.540
My trouble began on Independence Day.

01:33.540 --> 01:36.380
Not the Independence Day, but my Independence Day.

01:36.380 --> 01:39.660
My Independence Day occurred on Memorial Day, 1982.

01:39.660 --> 01:43.100
That was the day I told my family I was gay.

01:43.100 --> 01:47.460
The act itself, mom, dad, I'm gay,

01:47.460 --> 01:49.420
was relatively unexceptional.

01:49.420 --> 01:51.380
In fact, it should have been more exceptional,

01:51.380 --> 01:54.180
and I've always sort of wished that it had been.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.520
However, subsequent events overshadowed it,

01:56.520 --> 01:59.280
and it pales by comparison.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.400
The subsequent events occurred in my absence,

02:01.400 --> 02:04.360
after the fact, as I was in my car driving back to college

02:04.360 --> 02:06.560
to take my final freshman exams.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.560
I remember being on the highway and thinking

02:08.560 --> 02:11.960
how I kind of expected my parents to freak out a little.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.400
And to my surprise, they had not freaked out.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.760
They'd been calm and cool and collected,

02:17.760 --> 02:19.500
oddly calm, cool, and collected.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.520
But still, I was really happy as I drove back to school.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.020
Meanwhile, subsequent events were

02:24.020 --> 02:26.460
busy unfolding back home.

02:26.460 --> 02:29.020
My mother was going through the house where I grew up

02:29.020 --> 02:31.820
and was gathering together things I had made for her.

02:31.820 --> 02:36.620
A jewelry box when I was in 4-H, and a painting when I was 16.

02:36.620 --> 02:39.440
A box containing the letters that I'd

02:39.440 --> 02:43.020
written them from school, which I used to do every week.

02:43.020 --> 02:44.940
She was removing photographs from the walls

02:44.940 --> 02:47.460
and placing them in little piles around the house.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.780
And she was directing my father, who never dared not follow

02:50.840 --> 02:54.400
her direction, to take the bed and the desk and the chair

02:54.400 --> 02:57.880
and the lamp and the Smith Corona, Smith Corona even,

02:57.880 --> 03:01.480
and to put them all in the front yard next to the rock garden,

03:01.480 --> 03:05.240
not too close to the maple tree.

03:05.240 --> 03:10.360
My clothes, my books, my bookcases, my report cards,

03:10.360 --> 03:12.920
my Farrah Fawcett posters, my shoes,

03:12.920 --> 03:14.760
three years worth of interview magazines,

03:14.760 --> 03:20.160
the good ones with the Andy Warhol covers, everything.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.020
Then with my brother and my sister and my grandparents

03:23.020 --> 03:25.420
watching, my mother removed a cigarette

03:25.420 --> 03:28.260
from this tiny crocheted case she always kept them in.

03:28.260 --> 03:30.780
And she lit the cigarette, and then she took the match

03:30.780 --> 03:33.780
and put it to the pile of things there in the front yard that

03:33.780 --> 03:36.720
contained the sole and complete record of my existence

03:36.720 --> 03:37.380
and my family.

03:40.660 --> 03:42.860
It burned for 7 and 1 half hours,

03:42.860 --> 03:45.020
thanks in part to the addition of some lighter fluid

03:45.020 --> 03:49.060
to help get the larger pieces of furniture going.

03:49.060 --> 03:53.280
All of it, all that was me prior to that memorable Memorial

03:53.280 --> 03:55.840
Day up in flames.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.240
According to my sister, who years later recounted

03:58.240 --> 04:04.440
these details to me, it was a mighty impressive blaze.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.240
In their eagerness to feed it, and due to an unexpected wind

04:08.240 --> 04:11.280
off the fields around the house, the sugar maple

04:11.280 --> 04:12.880
that was older than my great grandfather

04:12.880 --> 04:16.160
caught a spark in its branches and was sacrificed.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.920
They cut off all communication with me.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.320
They emptied and closed our joint bank account.

04:25.320 --> 04:27.040
There goes college.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.480
They barred the door.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.160
They stopped talking, stopped answering my letters,

04:31.160 --> 04:32.280
stopped taking my calls.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.920
They stopped anything with me.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.560
They just stopped.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.320
I was completely disbelieving.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.200
I mean, this didn't make any sense.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.120
All of my friends had stories about telling

04:44.120 --> 04:46.160
their families they were gay, and they all ended the same way.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.280
Sooner or later, everything worked out fine.

04:48.340 --> 04:50.540
So I even had a friend named Neil,

04:50.540 --> 04:52.260
whose parents had done the same thing.

04:52.260 --> 04:54.500
At first, they just stopped talking to him.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.220
But one year later, they were inviting his new boyfriend

04:57.220 --> 05:00.020
to come home with him for the holidays.

05:00.020 --> 05:02.780
Everyone counseled me to have a little patience

05:02.780 --> 05:05.140
and have a little hope.

05:05.140 --> 05:09.300
And this is how it starts, slowly, just a little hope,

05:09.300 --> 05:12.380
just enough to get you through.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.420
But hope is cumulative.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.500
A little bit here and a little bit there,

05:16.520 --> 05:20.120
it builds up in the system until it becomes something toxic.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.920
Denial.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.440
I mean, their reaction had been, yes, extreme,

05:25.440 --> 05:27.480
but not the worst that could happen.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.280
The thing to do was to be a good son, to make them proud,

05:30.280 --> 05:33.120
to earn back their love.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.360
So I got a job, and then another, and then a third.

05:36.360 --> 05:40.760
Three shifts, three restaurants, six days a week.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.520
That would show them.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.240
But they weren't watching.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.980
I wrote them letters, lots of letters, about nothing.

05:49.980 --> 05:52.100
It's Tuesday, and it's hot.

05:52.100 --> 05:55.060
Or my new roommate is named Kathy.

05:55.060 --> 05:58.740
Or my friends took me out for my birthday yesterday.

05:58.740 --> 06:01.060
They didn't write back.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.820
Living, for me, sort of came to a halt,

06:03.820 --> 06:06.260
despite the fact that my life just went on and on.

06:06.260 --> 06:07.580
I didn't think about my future.

06:07.580 --> 06:08.860
I didn't think about my needs.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.380
I didn't think about my sadness.

06:10.380 --> 06:11.540
I didn't think about any of it.

06:11.540 --> 06:13.100
I didn't have to, because I had hope.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.700
Every day, whispering in my ear, don't give up.

06:15.700 --> 06:16.800
Don't walk away.

06:16.800 --> 06:17.800
You're almost there.

06:17.800 --> 06:18.720
Don't stop.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.360
Don't grow.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.680
Don't develop.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.640
Don't worry.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.040
Just don't make any sudden movements, or you'll blow it.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.480
So six years went on like this, without a word from them.

06:33.480 --> 06:38.920
So finally, hurt and confused beyond my ability

06:38.920 --> 06:40.960
to hold it in, and frankly, finding it really

06:40.960 --> 06:42.440
difficult to maintain the illusion

06:42.440 --> 06:44.120
that this was temporary.

06:44.140 --> 06:50.740
I decided to make one more attempt to force the issue.

06:50.740 --> 06:54.980
So I flew home and showed up unannounced at my mother's

06:54.980 --> 06:57.700
office.

06:57.700 --> 06:58.940
It was an amazing visit.

07:06.660 --> 07:10.180
I asked the receptionist to page my mother

07:10.180 --> 07:12.060
and tell her she had a surprise visitor.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.860
And I stood there in the lobby, and I

07:17.860 --> 07:20.180
remember seeing my mother come down this long hallway

07:20.180 --> 07:21.740
toward me.

07:21.740 --> 07:25.260
And she was walking, and then she sort of looked up,

07:25.260 --> 07:28.260
and she saw me.

07:28.260 --> 07:31.900
And then she recognized who it was,

07:31.900 --> 07:35.180
and she turned and walked away again.

07:35.180 --> 07:40.020
It was a really amazing 90-second visit.

07:40.020 --> 07:43.060
Two and a half weeks later, a black funeral wreath

07:43.060 --> 07:45.120
was delivered to me at my office with a note that

07:45.120 --> 07:50.040
said, in memory of our son.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.720
Clearly, it was time to give up hope and take up therapy.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.680
So I talked to a counselor who asked me

07:59.680 --> 08:03.720
why I had invited this turmoil into my life.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.440
I talked to a minister who suggested a Christian youth

08:06.440 --> 08:06.940
camp.

08:07.940 --> 08:13.860
I talked to a lesbian who offered

08:13.860 --> 08:18.700
to slash my mother's tires if I paid for her flight there.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.240
I signed up for scream therapy, where

08:20.240 --> 08:21.700
I beat pillows with tennis rackets

08:21.700 --> 08:23.740
and screamed obscenities and pulled

08:23.740 --> 08:25.180
a muscle in my shoulder.

08:25.180 --> 08:30.260
Mostly I talked to friends, and mostly the pain persisted.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.060
The sheer weight of it nearly crushed me,

08:33.060 --> 08:35.740
or at least that's how it felt at the time.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.700
Since it was my constant companion,

08:37.700 --> 08:42.620
I spent most of my time turning it over in my mind,

08:42.620 --> 08:47.120
fingering it like some sort of psychological worry stone.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.680
Over the years, it's been eroded by so much handling.

08:51.680 --> 08:57.500
All that remains now is a small, hard, nearly weightless pebble,

08:57.500 --> 08:58.920
really.

08:58.920 --> 09:02.680
Worn away is most of the anger and much of the hurt.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.540
But one question remains.

09:04.540 --> 09:06.420
How was it possible that they taught me

09:06.420 --> 09:09.300
love and loyalty in excess of that which they themselves

09:09.300 --> 09:09.800
possessed?

09:14.580 --> 09:16.500
I have come to believe that it's not

09:16.500 --> 09:18.580
possible to understand what they did.

09:18.580 --> 09:20.900
Not possible for me, anyway.

09:20.900 --> 09:25.060
To understand it would seem to indicate

09:25.060 --> 09:26.820
that there was some justification for it,

09:26.820 --> 09:30.020
and I know for certain that there is not.

09:30.020 --> 09:33.900
Still, there's no escaping my parents.

09:33.900 --> 09:38.100
This thing they did, this extreme and unfathomable

09:38.100 --> 09:40.340
and many layered thing they did, tore a hole

09:40.340 --> 09:42.420
in the middle of my life.

09:42.420 --> 09:46.460
I have spent years and a lot of money

09:46.460 --> 09:49.860
darning that hole while trying to keep the rest of my world

09:49.860 --> 09:52.020
from unraveling.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.500
And yet, their influence on me is enduring.

09:57.420 --> 10:01.020
My parents loved me terribly.

10:01.020 --> 10:04.940
I have been courageous in the face of bullies.

10:04.940 --> 10:08.860
There is such a thing as too much patience,

10:08.860 --> 10:13.660
but no such thing as too much forgiveness.

10:13.660 --> 10:18.220
And love has seen me through every misfortune.

10:18.220 --> 10:19.780
Thank you.

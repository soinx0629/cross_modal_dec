00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Felly rydw i'n ymwneud yn y botwm ffon ac rydw i'n rhoi £0.20 yn ymwneud ac rydw i'n ffon fy ffrind, ac mae'n cymryd.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Felly rydw i'n rhoi £0.50 yn ymwneud.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Ac roedden ni'n mynd i ddweud.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Rydw i'n teimlo'r ddau yn ôl i mi.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Rydw i'n mynd i ddweud.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Rydw i'n mynd i ddweud.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
Rydw i'n teimlo'r ddau yn ôl i'r botwm ffon ac rydw i'n gweld ychwanegu'r ddau.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Yn ystod y tu allan, roeddwn i'n byw ar y fflat fy ffrind.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Roedd hi'n byw ar y camys Unedig yn y Cynulliad Cymru.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Roedd hi'n byw ar gyfer gwaith ac roedd hi wedi rhoi'r llwybr i'n fflat,

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
allwn i'n byw ar y camys Unedig,

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
unrhyw lle yn Hansworth Ward,

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
ond pan oeddwn i'n byw ar y fflat yn y Llyfrgell,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
roeddwn i'n dechrau bod yn sianol i'n mynd i'n mynd i hefyd.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Roeddwn i'n byw ym mhob.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Roeddwn i'n byw ym mhob, roeddwn i'n byw yn y ddau,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
ac roeddwn i'n byw ar fy mhob.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.980
Oherwydd o'r hyn, roedd y ffordd yn fy holl ddweud,

01:22.980 --> 01:25.920
dweud dweud dweud,

01:25.920 --> 01:28.600
ond rwy'n gwybod i dweud.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.920
Ac un o'r ffordd, roedd y ffordd dweud dweud,

01:30.920 --> 01:33.600
dweud dweud dweud.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.720
Now to tell you the truth,

01:34.720 --> 01:37.920
I wasn't really sure what to make of this voice.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.520
It made me quite anxious,

01:39.520 --> 01:41.520
but I couldn't quite figure out what it meant

01:41.520 --> 01:43.780
or what could possibly happen.

01:43.780 --> 01:47.040
And I had to think about it for a while.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.880
And eventually I decided,

01:48.880 --> 01:51.640
no, I'm going to go home.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.800
But to appease this voice in my head,

01:54.800 --> 01:58.560
I decided to remove my jewellery, my watch,

01:58.560 --> 02:00.280
leave my cards behind and my cash,

02:00.280 --> 02:03.360
but just take enough money for my bus fare there

02:03.360 --> 02:05.360
and to return the following morning

02:05.360 --> 02:07.080
and enough also to phone my boyfriend

02:07.080 --> 02:09.640
from the payphone on campus.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.440
And so I set off.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.640
And it was probably about, I don't know,

02:13.640 --> 02:16.600
8.30 in the evening.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.280
So I was studying in Birmingham

02:18.280 --> 02:21.320
and their subways, particularly when I was there,

02:21.320 --> 02:24.640
had a reputation for being quite seedy and unsafe.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.040
And I had actually been flashed at

02:26.040 --> 02:28.760
a number of times down there.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.440
But on this particular occasion,

02:30.440 --> 02:32.200
as I walked through the tunnel,

02:32.200 --> 02:35.520
I noticed a female police officer ahead of me.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.240
And I remember thinking this was a good omen.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.560
I kind of broke my stride

02:40.560 --> 02:43.440
so we were almost walking in tandem

02:43.440 --> 02:45.200
without making it too obvious.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.960
And then I exit the subway

02:46.960 --> 02:49.240
and I get to my bus stop.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.600
And usually, regardless of what the timetable says,

02:52.600 --> 02:55.720
I always have to wait half an hour for my bus.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.960
But on this particular evening,

02:57.960 --> 02:59.600
it comes within minutes.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.240
So when I get on the bus,

03:02.240 --> 03:03.840
I actually sit near the bus driver

03:03.840 --> 03:06.560
because I think this is the most sensible thing to do.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.520
And then I arrive at my stop.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.160
And at this point, I'd say,

03:12.160 --> 03:14.800
I'm pretty much on the home stretch.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.440
All I have to do now is get home.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.520
And as I'm walking along the street,

03:20.520 --> 03:24.200
I suddenly notice an empty phone box on the corner.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.200
And in that moment, I decide,

03:26.200 --> 03:28.800
I'm going to call my boyfriend from there.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.160
Now, I make this decision

03:30.160 --> 03:33.640
because the payphone on my campus serves about 50 people

03:33.640 --> 03:35.600
and it's always ringing off the hook.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.760
So if I really want to speak to my boyfriend tonight,

03:37.760 --> 03:40.480
this is my best chance.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.720
I realise at this point,

03:42.720 --> 03:44.800
I'm slightly deviating from the plan

03:44.800 --> 03:46.960
of just going straight home.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.880
But I can distinctly remember

03:48.880 --> 03:51.280
as I felt the door close behind me.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.840
I'm safe in here.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.960
It's a box.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.880
So I put my money in and I call my boyfriend.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.720
And then suddenly, I feel the door behind me open.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.400
A hand appears out of nowhere

04:09.400 --> 04:12.480
and I watch it press down the switch hook of the phone.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.000
I hear the pound coin drop to the bottom

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
and I watch this hand remove the coin.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.280
I don't remember dropping the receiver,

04:25.240 --> 04:29.320
but I do remember seeing it swing from side to side.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.440
Suddenly, these arms tighten around me

04:32.440 --> 04:35.560
and I can feel something sharp against my neck.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.080
And I'm scared.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.000
I'm so scared.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.440
My mouth is dry and I can hardly breathe

04:44.440 --> 04:47.440
and my heart is beating so fast,

04:47.440 --> 04:49.760
I can feel it pulsing in the back of my throat

04:49.760 --> 04:52.240
like at any moment it could just rip through.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.680
And I'm fighting so hard to stop my knees from buckling.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.080
And I keep saying to myself over and over again,

05:01.080 --> 05:03.080
is this happening?

05:03.080 --> 05:04.240
This isn't happening.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.480
Is this really happening?

05:07.480 --> 05:12.480
I think I'm told not to move or make a sound,

05:14.560 --> 05:16.440
but I can't be sure.

05:16.440 --> 05:20.280
He asks me for money, but I don't have any.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.680
No, wait, I do.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.240
I have 75 pence.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.920
I think he thinks I'm mocking him,

05:25.920 --> 05:28.320
so I give him my bag and he turns me around

05:28.320 --> 05:30.560
and he pushes me up against the phone.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.760
And through the sheer panic of it all,

05:35.600 --> 05:37.560
something happened to me.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.520
I was suddenly overcome by this strange sense

05:42.520 --> 05:45.680
of calm, presence and lucidity.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.680
My senses were heightened

05:48.680 --> 05:52.560
and I could feel and sense everything around me.

05:52.560 --> 05:57.040
It was like I was inhabiting every cell of my body

05:57.040 --> 05:59.800
and I think time must have stood still or something

05:59.800 --> 06:03.160
because after that everything happened in slow motion.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.080
The voice in my head asks me,

06:08.840 --> 06:12.520
so how does this end?

06:12.520 --> 06:14.160
What happens now?

06:15.560 --> 06:18.040
And so I start running through all these different scenarios

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
in my mind.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.160
Or maybe I'm stabbed and I die.

06:24.680 --> 06:28.560
Or maybe I'm raped, stabbed and then I die.

06:29.760 --> 06:33.520
Or maybe, maybe I'm stabbed,

06:33.520 --> 06:35.520
but I go into intensive care,

06:37.240 --> 06:40.680
but then I slip into a coma and then I die.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.920
And the voice says,

06:43.920 --> 06:45.320
well, whatever way you look at this,

06:45.320 --> 06:47.680
you really have nothing to lose.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.920
But if you do survive, the police will want a description.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.840
You need to get a description.

06:55.320 --> 07:00.320
So I slowly raise my hands and I turn around to face him.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.440
And I tell him to check my pockets for money

07:04.440 --> 07:06.400
just in case he doesn't believe me.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.040
And as he does, I look at him

07:12.440 --> 07:14.560
and I take the image of him in.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.800
The colour of his hair, his eyes,

07:21.360 --> 07:24.240
his clothing, his height,

07:26.480 --> 07:28.400
and the Stanley knife in his hand.

07:30.560 --> 07:34.360
He looks up and he notices the tracking movements of my eyes

07:34.360 --> 07:36.160
and he quickly turns me around

07:36.160 --> 07:38.320
and he forces me up against the phone.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.920
His hands start to move over my breasts.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.000
And the voice says, don't move.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.800
Don't even flinch.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.240
Let him touch you.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.320
Let him think he has you.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.960
And so I do.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.560
Let him touch me.

08:05.720 --> 08:06.920
And for a brief moment,

08:06.920 --> 08:10.960
I can almost sense a slight release of tension in his arm.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.600
And all the while, I kept thinking to myself,

08:14.600 --> 08:16.200
how did I get into the phone box?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.520
Which way did the door open?

08:17.520 --> 08:19.280
What side of the door was the handle on?

08:19.280 --> 08:20.960
Which hand did I use?

08:22.720 --> 08:27.720
Meanwhile, his hands are travelling downwards

08:28.120 --> 08:29.520
towards my groin.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.000
And in that moment, I decide,

08:34.640 --> 08:35.840
I'd rather die.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.520
I grab his arms and I use my weight

08:40.520 --> 08:42.840
to push him backwards into the door.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.240
And using my elbows, I swing to the right

08:45.240 --> 08:47.040
so that as I swing to the left,

08:47.040 --> 08:50.160
I use his weight to leverage the door open.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.720
And the door opens and so I run.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.440
And I'm screaming, I think.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.520
But then I stop running

08:58.520 --> 09:00.000
because I realise very quickly

09:00.000 --> 09:02.240
he's not chasing me.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.360
He's run away.

09:05.320 --> 09:06.800
I don't know what it was in that moment

09:06.800 --> 09:09.800
if it was just the effects of the adrenaline.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.960
But all I wanted to do was find him

09:11.960 --> 09:14.320
so that I could stab him and kill him.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.400
But as I'm looking around, I don't see anyone,

09:18.400 --> 09:21.360
apart from an Indian man standing in the driveway

09:21.360 --> 09:23.880
of his house next to his car.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.160
He shouts to me, are you okay?

09:26.160 --> 09:29.120
Of course I'm not okay, I've just been mugged.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.440
Which way did he go?

09:31.360 --> 09:34.400
I start running down a dark road

09:34.400 --> 09:36.720
and the man chases me and brings me back,

09:36.720 --> 09:38.920
telling me it's not a good idea.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.400
He walks me to the phone box

09:41.400 --> 09:45.320
where I pick up my bag and I replace the handset.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.840
And the phone rings.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.960
And so, for some bizarre reason, I answer it.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.000
It's my boyfriend.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.160
He tells me he's been trying to call me

09:58.160 --> 10:00.080
for the last two minutes.

10:01.040 --> 10:01.880
What?

10:02.840 --> 10:03.960
Are you sure?

10:05.800 --> 10:10.200
I hang up and then the Indian man offers to drive me home.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.920
I tell him he's crazy, I'm not getting in a car with you.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.360
You're a stranger, you're a man.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.960
He offers to bring his wife along so that I feel safe.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.960
It's just that now I have to wait for her

10:21.960 --> 10:25.680
because she has to get ready and get her purse.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.040
So as I stand outside the door,

10:28.040 --> 10:29.640
waiting for her,

10:29.640 --> 10:32.680
every single member of the family appears at the door

10:32.680 --> 10:34.400
wanting to know what happened,

10:34.400 --> 10:36.320
wanting to come along for the ride.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.960
Eventually, everyone is seated in the car.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.120
Everyone except for me.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.240
There's no room for me to sit.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.800
Someone has to get out of the car

10:51.800 --> 10:55.720
so that I can get in, so that I can go home.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.400
Eventually, it's agreed that the grandfather will stay behind.

11:03.080 --> 11:07.440
The drive is excruciatingly slow

11:07.440 --> 11:12.440
owing to the weight of the car and so claustrophobic.

11:13.480 --> 11:17.520
I burst into tears and the grandmother says,

11:17.520 --> 11:20.680
stop crying, what are you crying for?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.240
It's not like you were raped.

11:23.240 --> 11:26.520
Oh, wait a minute, she says.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.880
He didn't touch you down there, did he?

11:31.920 --> 11:33.600
No?

11:33.600 --> 11:35.760
Well, that's all right then

11:35.760 --> 11:38.120
because otherwise you would have been spoiled.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.760
We get to the car park and I ask to be let down.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.240
They offer to walk me to my door and I flat out refuse.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.560
As I watch the car pull away,

11:55.040 --> 11:58.000
I realise as I stand in this dark car park,

11:59.480 --> 12:00.760
I'm breathing again.

12:01.840 --> 12:06.080
It's only in that moment I realise I'm home.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.440
I made it home.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.600
Thank you.

0	11160	So, as I sit down to eat from this spread that has been given in my honor, I can't help
11160	14560	but notice the two feelings that I'm having.
14560	17400	One, I'm a little nervous.
17400	26160	Two, I'm very excited because you see, in the morning, I'll be paroling from state prison
26160	31120	after 26 years.
31120	35400	The spread is given to me, not as like to say, hey, homie, we appreciate you.
35400	41640	No, it was a spread to say, we don't never want to see your ass in here again.
41640	48000	And they broke out the finest of the finest, top ramen, chili in a can, roast beef in
48000	53480	a can, you know, this top line of stuff, right?
53520	60520	So, after the spread has been had, it's time for me to give away some property, such as
60520	66520	my TV, my radio, and some self-help books that help me a lot, so they'll be better utilized
66520	68800	left behind.
68800	72080	Nine o'clock rolls around, it's lights out.
72080	77800	You don't have to go to sleep, but you do got to get off the day room floor.
77800	81400	It's cool about me, I'm leaving in the morning.
81400	86120	So, I may have gotten like three hours worth of sleep that night.
86120	89840	I slept ready roll, and that means I slept with my clothes on.
89840	91920	Soon as they call my name, I'm out of there.
91920	94320	Bye, see you later.
94320	103280	So 545 rolls around, the night man says, Cyprian D37-875, report to R&R.
103280	109640	I walked down that corridor for the last time, walked through one gate after another till
109640	116320	I get to R&R, and that's receiving and release, and I'm on the release end at this point.
116320	122960	I get to R&R, and there's about seven to six other guys waiting for the same thing.
122960	129920	They start fingerprinting me, mug shots, and everything, I'm cool, like, time to go.
129920	135760	So they load us onto a van, and we drive through one gate after another gate, till we get to
135760	137440	the final gate.
137480	142920	The cop says, all right, everybody off the van, you'll step to the man at the base of
142920	147120	the tower there, and you'll give him some personal information.
147120	157640	So we did, and he gave each man an envelope with $200 in it, better known as gate money.
157640	162140	We all got back onto the van and drove through that last gate.
162140	168180	We made it around to the visitor's parking lot, and he asks, is there anyone with a ride?
168180	169780	I do.
169780	172140	I was the only one to get off the van.
172140	177060	These other guys, that $200 gate money, they had to spend it on buying their bus tickets,
177060	183140	maybe back to Southern California or even further up north, but I was the lucky one.
183140	185700	My wife was waiting there.
185700	190060	With her camera, I could see her, she was snapping pictures of me like a paparazzi.
190100	195220	I walked briskly towards her, gave her a quick kiss, whispered it in her ear, let's get out
195220	200740	of here before they say we made a mistake.
200740	206380	We got in the car, drove away, I saw a 7-Eleven, I was like, hey babe, pull over, I want to
206380	209020	go in and get something.
209020	213220	So I went in and grabbed a pack of Big Red gum.
213220	216900	I hadn't had chewing gum in 26 years.
216900	219640	Big Red was my favorite.
219640	228640	We got back in the car, drove away, we were on the road for about 30 to 45 minutes.
228640	230680	I spotted a Target.
230680	237120	I said, hey babe, that's Target, I saw that on the TV, pull over, I want to go in there.
237120	239000	So we did.
239000	248480	The first thing that caught my eye was how big the shopping basket was.
248480	254640	It was bigger than the space that I had to store my personal property while in prison.
254640	258920	I grabbed the basket and went down the aisle grabbing various things such as underwear,
258920	263440	socks, t-shirt, toothbrush, toothpaste, you name it, I grabbed it.
263440	268280	Well, that goes at $200 gate money.
268280	276040	So back in the car, and my wife says, so what do you want for dinner?
276040	279120	She stumped me with that one.
279120	283040	Because for 26 years, no one had ever asked me, what do I want for dinner?
283040	286760	My dinner came through a 13 by 13 hole in the wall.
286760	289800	You stick your hand in there and pull out a tray and what's ever on there, that's what
289800	293860	you eat.
293860	295640	So she says, I know what to fix.
295640	301560	So she drove, we made it to the grocery store, went into the grocery store.
301560	311400	This gigantic store, Berkeley Bowl.
311400	316340	So I made it to the produce section.
316340	318640	I'm stuck.
318640	322900	There are so many oranges to choose from.
322900	327600	And the reason I'm stuck just looking at the oranges is because for the past 10 years in
328240	334980	prison, they had taken oranges away from us because they were used to make wine.
334980	340960	So there's like a bumpy orange, a smooth orange, a naval orange.
340960	347040	I even met my first blood orange.
347040	355080	And at the same time, this wave hit me of alone and feeling like, I don't know, a nervous
355080	360680	feeling hit me like I'm the only person in this store who's paroled from a prison today
360680	363000	after 26 years.
363000	367280	I'm a little stuck and a little, ooh.
367280	371960	So I'm looking around and I spot this ink work.
371960	374760	It's not the typical ink work that I see out here now.
374760	375760	Like what color?
375760	377080	No, I know this ink work.
377080	378280	This is prison ink.
378280	383680	He has a prison guard tower on him, a melted clock with time.
383680	384680	I know that work.
384680	386400	I've seen that many times.
386400	391800	So I walk over to him and I whisper, so what yard did you parole from?
391800	392800	He said, oh me?
392800	395440	I got, I paroled from Pelican Bay like four months ago.
395440	398600	I'm like, and they know you got out of prison?
398600	399600	They know you're on parole?
399600	401000	Oh yeah, they're not tripping here.
401000	402000	This is Berkeley, man.
402000	406120	Nobody's tripping.
406120	413920	Well I walked away from him with the understanding that if he can get a job, so can I.
413920	417200	So I met my wife at the checkout.
417200	420360	Once again, there's another stunned moment for me.
420360	427120	There are 12 checkout lines and there's somebody on the other end bagging the groceries.
427120	435040	In prison, there was one window, maybe 13 by 13 again, and there was like 300 guys waiting
435040	441680	to get into this one window with their lists.
441760	445480	I didn't have to worry about an alarm going off or anything, no getting down.
445480	447640	We're going to get our groceries and leave out of here.
447640	448960	That was my thought.
448960	450720	Cool.
450720	455320	So we made it through the checkout, went back to the car, got in the car and we're on the
455320	460080	road and we come to a stoplight.
460080	465780	And this homeless guy had a sign that says, anything will help.
465780	471160	So my wife reaches into the cup holder and gets ready to hand him some change.
471160	474640	And all of a sudden he gets a phone call.
474640	481600	And he tells my wife, wait, I got to get this.
481600	489000	And my thoughts were like, if he got a cell phone, I got to get one.
489000	495560	So we drive away and my wife, she just drives real fast, right?
495560	500320	And we make it to the neighborhood just as fast as we got to the store and she pulls
500400	503760	into the neighborhood and she points out the various neighbors house.
503760	505240	This is where Fred and Mike live.
505240	507360	The brewers live here.
507360	509440	And I'm like, OK, and we get to our house.
509440	510880	And she said, and this is us.
510880	513800	We live at the edge of the forest.
513800	516880	Like, cool, cool.
516880	520440	And so we went inside and she gives me the grand tour.
520440	524600	And so she says, well, I'm going to prepare this dinner.
524600	526160	I said, cool.
526200	530360	So she made steak and lobster with small potatoes.
530360	533440	Nothing out of a can, folks.
533440	535720	Nothing out of a packet either.
535720	537040	She made this meal.
537040	537840	We sat down.
537840	539760	We ate.
539760	545360	And I had my first glass of wine with my meal.
545360	547400	I'm not saying I've never had wine before.
547400	548880	I've never had wine with a meal.
551960	553840	This is some grown folks shit, I thought.
557160	559240	Right?
559240	565360	So after the meal was finished, we're cleaning up, washing dishes.
565360	568760	My wife says, you want to get further acclimated?
568760	571000	I'm like, yeah.
571000	572520	She said, take out the garbage.
576520	578040	No problem.
578040	581720	I reach down, tie that garbage bag up, throw it over my shoulder,
581720	584280	and out to the front door I go.
584280	588920	When I open up the door, no more than eight feet away from me
588920	593720	was a 10-point buck just standing there, looking at me,
593720	596960	looking at it, staring at me.
596960	598640	Now, had we been on a prison yard,
598640	602320	me and his buck would have had issues.
602320	604560	Now, I speak a lot of different gangster languages.
604560	605920	I'm fluent in Crip.
605920	607120	I understand blood.
607120	609280	I even speak a little ese cholo vato loco.
609280	610520	But I don't speak deer.
614000	617080	So I shut the door.
617080	618200	I called out to my wife.
618200	623360	I said, hey, babe, there's somebody here to see you.
623360	627360	She came to the door, opened it, and saw there was the buck.
627360	631360	She grabbed the trash bag and walked right past it.
631360	633160	I said, damn, she speaks deer.
634160	635960	I said, damn, she speaks deer.
639480	641520	She came back, and we both look out the door
641520	644520	together at this buck who's still standing there,
644520	647240	just looking just majestic as could be.
650240	654000	And my wife says, you don't need to trip him.
654000	658240	He's just one neighbor coming to welcome you to the neighborhood.
658240	659160	Cool.
659160	661800	I thought, well, the fellas aren't
661800	665000	going to believe this shit when I tell them this.
665000	667440	I met my first deer.
667440	670720	I met my first blood orange.
670720	673400	I had my first glass of wine with my meal.
677280	681400	This is my first day of my new life.
681400	684320	What's tomorrow going to bring me?
684320	685880	Thank you.

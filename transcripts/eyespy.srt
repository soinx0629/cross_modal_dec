1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
I grew up in Providence, Rhode Island, and for my entire childhood, we were never more

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,800
than 20 miles away from the core of our universe, the Kennedys.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
We were Irish, they were Irish.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,840
We were Catholic, they were Catholic.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,680
They were family.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,360
We were like the relatives that they never got to see.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,360
But we knew, you know, they're busy, and we knew that they loved us.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,980
So anything that was happening to them was also happening to us.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,760
So their tragedy, plus our own tragedy, was a lot.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,360
So this one Thanksgiving after dinner and a family fight at Grandma's house, we were

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,800
in the car and we're driving home.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,600
And the radio was playing this 10th anniversary of the JFK assassination.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,820
And I'm sitting in the back seat, and I start to cry.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,800
And my sister Erin says, hey, Dad, Michaela's crying.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,220
And my father pulls that car right over to the shoulder of I-95.

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,240
He stops it, he turns around, and he looks at us.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:12,000
And with tears in his own eyes, he says, don't you ever be ashamed to cry for that man.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,320
So my parents grew up near Newport, and they got married in the same exact church as Jack

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,380
and Jackie, St. Mary's.

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:26,380
And my father gave exact replica jewelry to my mother that was replications of the jewelry

21
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,700
that Jack gave to Jackie.

22
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,920
And every Saturday night after mass, my family would be in the living room and we'd be happily

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,440
ever aftering to the original soundtrack of Camelot.

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,700
And every year during the 70s, my four aunts would take me and my two cousins on their

25
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:51,620
dream vacation, a rented beach house in Hyannis on the very cove sharing beachfront with the

26
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,280
Kennedy compound.

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,700
Every day for an entire week, my Aunt Pat would roll up her sister's hair.

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,500
My aunts would apply sunscreen to the back of their necks, the backs of the hands, and

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,100
the tops of their feet.

30
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,920
And then they would drag their beach chairs down to the beach, and they would set them

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:18,200
up perfectly, not facing the water, not into the sun for tanning, but perfectly for spying

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,440
on the Kennedys.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,000
They would sit there all day in the broiling sun with high-powered binoculars and keep

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,480
a constant surveillance.

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,000
And every year they'd have the same exact conversations.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,320
Usually around mid-morning, the first sighting would be made, usually by my Aunt Pat.

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:48,280
She'd be, up, they got Rose out, walking, Ethel looks drawn.

38
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,020
And then about an hour later, my Aunt Gert would say, how old is Rose now?

39
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,880
And Aunt Momo would make the calculations.

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,200
Well, let's see.

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,640
Jack died in 63 when she was 74, and Rose's birthday was two weeks last Thursday, and

42
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,040
Joe died in 69, making her a widow at 81, so 85.

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,880
And then they'd break for lunch.

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,480
So after lobster and drawn butter and hosing us down, they'd all hustle back to their posts,

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
and they'd watch.

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,520
And every now and then, there'd be something they didn't know.

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
Hey, who's that?

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Who's that?

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Who's that?

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,600
So they'd draw out the family tree in the sand, they'd analyze it, they'd come up with

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,800
a profile, and they'd crack the code.

52
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,840
It's one of Bobby's.

53
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Now any mention of Bobby would always bring up the inevitable, oh, I just pray to God

54
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,560
they don't tell poor senile Rose about Bobby, it'll break her.

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,720
So then the long afternoon stretch would end with the inevitable annual observation, you

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,420
don't see Jackie much here.

57
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,880
And then all of my aunts would drop their binoculars and look at each other meaningfully.

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,320
Now all of this meant that no one was paying any attention to me and my cousins in the

59
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,440
water.

60
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,400
And the summer when we were nine years old, we found something.

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,800
Now had an aunt, perhaps in an effort to ease a cramp in her prying neck, just sort of glanced

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,060
towards the water.

63
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,740
She might have seen us climbing into this tiny plastic half inflated boat.

64
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,720
She might have cried out an alarm at the lack of oars and life vests.

65
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,640
She might have had a conniption fit to see us shove off and drift into the violent rip

66
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,520
tide that would sweep us within five minutes out to the open sea and the Nantucket bound

67
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,400
ferry.

68
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,280
But an aunt didn't, and we did.

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,440
It all happened so fast that we were swept out, and it wasn't until we realized that

70
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,060
we could make out the specific features of the ferry passengers that we were really

71
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,920
far from shore.

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,120
We were so far from shore that my aunts were now reduced to four hopping dots.

73
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,080
Uh oh, it was like Gilligan's Island for real.

74
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,680
So an Atlantic swell crashes over our heads, and as soon as the water clears out of our

75
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,720
eyes, a powerboat pulls up out of nowhere.

76
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,040
And in this powerboat are David and Michael Kennedy.

77
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,640
So David and Michael pull us up into the boat, and we are like, oh my God, we are saved by

78
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,680
a powerboat.

79
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,560
So the powerboat sends us back to shore, and we're psyched because we're saved until we

80
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,160
start to watch the four hopping dots morph back into our four crazed, livid aunts.

81
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,560
We are so going to get it.

82
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,640
Now my family under any circumstances has this really weird thing, well they each have

83
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,840
like their own weird thing, about like yelling and getting into huge trouble.

84
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,640
Like my aunt Gur, like she gets so freaked out that all she can do is yell out our addresses.

85
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,800
Like Eileen and Kevin, 275 Hooper Street.

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,560
Michaela, 180 Asylum Road.

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,120
I swear to God, I grew up on Asylum Road.

88
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,640
It's a very telling piece of my childhood.

89
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,880
And then my aunt Pat would do these things where she would say these things that were

90
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,400
like actually kind of nice things, but she'd say them like they were death threats.

91
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,560
She'd be like, yeah, I'll save you from drowning.

92
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,160
You get on that beach towel and you lie in that sun, now.

93
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,520
Or she'd say, I'm going to buy you a birthday present.

94
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,360
You eat that cake, now.

95
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,880
So we knew that this is what was coming.

96
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,360
The Kennedy boys didn't.

97
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,880
So they're vivaciously tanned and they pull up to the shoreline and we brace ourselves.

98
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,560
Now what happens is our aunts are out of their minds.

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
They're ready to flay us.

100
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,960
But when they see us in the same boat as the Kennedys, it's like they don't have the

101
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,040
emotional capacity to handle it.

102
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,160
They kind of snap.

103
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,800
They're kind of like freaking out to yell at us, but they start fake smiling and trying

104
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,840
to act all normal.

105
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,600
And my aunt Momo, she takes on this Kennedy-esque way of speaking, which is sort of halfway

106
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,280
between Katharine Hepburn and the Queen of England.

107
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,640
And we're looking at them like, what are you guys doing?

108
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,880
And they're smiling to smile, but when they smile at us, it's like, you just wait.

109
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,880
But they're like, oh, David, oh, Michael, thank you, thank you, thank you.

110
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,480
And they're not mad at us for almost drowning.

111
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,960
They're mad at us because the Kennedys had to save us.

112
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,000
Like don't those people have enough trouble?

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,400
Now you?

114
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,960
Like as if our almost drowning was yet another Kennedy tragedy.

115
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,320
So these poor boys finally pull and pry themselves away from my aunts.

116
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,400
They get back on the boat and they're leaving and my aunt Momo's going, please give our

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,000
best to your grandmother.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,280
And now it's time for our for real punishment, which was that we for the rest of vacation

119
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,400
had to stay on the beach because we did not have any respect for the water.

120
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,520
So it's a hundred degrees out.

121
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,240
And after about a half hour of whining and fighting and like emptying out all the copper

122
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,560
tone and kicking sand, we break my aunt Pat's last nerve and she says, all right, you can

123
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,400
go in the water, but only up to your knees.

124
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,880
So we're happy for a minute until we get in the water and realize how boring up to

125
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,320
your knees is.

126
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,480
And then we get the great plan of having chicken fights.

127
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,920
So we start to have chicken fights, but it's kind of weird because there's only three of

128
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
us.

129
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,500
So, but we're doing the best we can to have a chicken fight like that and like knock each

130
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,240
other off into the water so we get fully immersed.

131
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,580
And then my uncle Al, who never ever played with us ever comes into the water to play

132
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,800
chicken fights with us and he puts his daughter, my cousin Eileen up on his shoulders.

133
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,240
And then I get up on my cousin Kevin's shoulders and we're having chicken fights and it's like

134
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,160
actual family fun for a moment.

135
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,100
And we're like, you know, hitting each other, falling in the water.

136
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:56,560
And then I take my foot and I accidentally kick the side of my uncle Al's head really,

137
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:09,840
really hard and his eyeball pops out of his head, falls into the water and sinks.

138
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,960
It pops out of his head and it sinks.

139
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,160
Eileen, Kevin and I are in instant complete shock.

140
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,680
Right this minute there is still a part of me that is on that beach screaming.

141
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,120
It's like, oh my God, we had no idea that he had a fake eye.

142
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,840
We didn't even know that you could have a fake eye.

143
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,040
Why would you have a fake eye?

144
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,920
They didn't tell us that you, that uncle Al had a fake eye because they didn't want his

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,280
blabbing it to the whole neighborhood.

146
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
So they didn't tell us.

147
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
So we didn't know.

148
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,680
And like later on, you know, there was Columbo and Sandy Duncan, but this was way before that.

149
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,920
We had no idea.

150
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,560
So we're all standing there and it's like so horrible.

151
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,080
Like I can't even like, I'm like, oh my God.

152
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,060
And, and my cousins Eileen and Kevin are staring at me with complete hate.

153
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,440
Like you broke our dad.

154
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,280
And my uncle Al is standing there and he's got the lid open so you can like see inside

155
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,040
the socket where now it's just like skin and the eyeball gone.

156
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,640
And like, you cannot just say I'm sorry to someone that you just, so I don't know what

157
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
to do.

158
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,620
And my aunt Pat is hysterically screaming because that eyeball cost top dollar.

159
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,720
It was a special magnetized eye so it could keep up with the other one.

160
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,480
And now I had just been to pray that vacation was over and that they got that deposit back

161
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,640
because now they were going to have to buy a brand new top dollar eye that was not in

162
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,200
the budget.

163
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
So I just didn't know what to do.

164
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,360
I was like, my life is over.

165
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,220
I am no longer Michaela.

166
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,400
I am now Murph's girl who kicked Al's eye out in the cape.

167
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,060
And it's awful and everybody's just crying and pointing at me and now my other aunts

168
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,720
are getting in on it like and who's the blame part of the conversations happening.

169
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,200
So I just kind of back off into the water.

170
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,760
I'm kind of like going back and like regressing back to like where life as I once knew it

171
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
had ended.

172
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,600
And I just stand there and like, I kind of wish I had drowned and I kind of wish

173
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,680
the Kennedys hadn't saved me.

174
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,120
And I bent off into the waves and I just, I just started like sifting through sand and

175
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,040
shells and pebbles and it's totally ridiculous but like I will never stop looking for this

176
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
eye.

177
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm going to look forever.

178
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,960
And I keep looking and looking and I'm sifting through and then all of a sudden there is

179
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,720
an eyeball in my palm staring right at me.

180
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,520
And so I scream and I drop it back and it sinks back into the water.

181
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,160
But now we know it's possible.

182
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,320
So everybody gets back into the water and now we're all sifting through and sifting

183
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,760
through and I pray to God for no more future happiness until we find this eye.

184
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,080
And I also kind of pray that it not be me that finds it this time.

185
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,400
So after like an hour my cousin Kevin finds the eye and he holds it up in triumph and

186
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
he does not let go.

187
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:59,260
And my uncle Al takes the eye, he like washes it off and just pops it back in.

188
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,480
And then he kind of like tests it, you know, and it's like keeping up with the other one.

189
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,120
So it's working still.

190
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,080
And now it's the weirdest thing because now we know it's a fake eye.

191
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,720
And now that you know it's a fake eye, it totally looks like a fake eye.

192
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,280
And I can't believe that I never noticed it wasn't a fake eye before.

193
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,760
So now vacation's back on.

194
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,380
And so everybody gets back into their beach chairs and they start to settle down to begin

195
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,920
telling the story over and over like a million times about what I just did.

196
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,420
And I have not really fully reintegrated back into the family yet.

197
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,600
I'm kind of standing apart.

198
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,560
And I notice that there actually has been like kind of a group of people who've been

199
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,360
watching this whole thing.

200
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,400
And then I see something that I didn't notice that no one noticed.

201
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,840
And that's that two of the Kennedy kids, David and Michael, had taken a walk on the beach.

202
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:51,280
And I can tell just by the look on their faces that they had stood there and seen the entire

203
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:59,080
episode, that they had been there watching us.

204
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,320
Thank you.

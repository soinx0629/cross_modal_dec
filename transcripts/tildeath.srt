1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
It was five days before my ten-year high school reunion when my husband told me he thought

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,000
he might be gay.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,480
He wasn't sure he was gay because he had never been with a man yet, but he thought it was

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,640
something he ought to figure out.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,800
Good idea.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,080
Now I think he told me this at that moment, not to get out of my high school reunion,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,480
which would be understandable, but in order to, because we had been looking for houses

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,840
together and we'd finally found one in Pasadena that we both liked.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,080
And I think somehow the forever of a wedding vow sounded kind of vague and idealistic to

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,480
him where his 30-year mortgage was surprisingly specific.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,520
It was a commitment, you know, the kind of commitment you shouldn't make while your sexuality

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,520
is pending.

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:55,840
Now, as he was explaining this to me, I was thinking downstairs, our neighbors, we lived

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,480
in this duplex apartment we were renting, the Kaufmans were probably just sitting down

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,600
to dinner as they'd done for 52 years and talking about their brisket, and they were

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,120
this couple that used to come up and see our new furniture, like when we bought a new antique

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:19,120
table because Sam liked antique shopping, pink flag, and so they were like parent figures

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
to us.

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,240
And, you know, there were signs, like when I first met Sam, he had this leather jacket

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,120
with tiger print lining, and I remember thinking it seemed kind of, the lining, I don't know

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
it stuck with me.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,080
And then, you know, but then he asked me out, and we slept together, and he asked me to

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:43,600
marry him, and I put on the big white dress, which he helped me pick out in front, seriously,

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,480
in front of, you know, 200 of my closest friends, and I figured he's not.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,000
And also, I actually, I guess there was one thing I ignored, which I probably should have

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
paid attention to.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,400
He told me before we were, while we were engaged, he told me he sometimes noticed men, but he

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,920
said he couldn't imagine sleeping with a man, and, you know, he just noticed them.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,560
And I guess I knew this was not good because I didn't talk to any girlfriends about this,

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,840
and I talk to girlfriends about everything.

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,400
So if I didn't, it was probably bad.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,480
But I did, at one point, I did talk to one girlfriend, we were in line at Disneyland

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,120
for Space Mountain, and I told her how Sam had said he sometimes noticed men, and do

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
you think that's bad?

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,040
And she said, you know, she told me this theory of the spectrum of sexuality, and everyone

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,000
lies somewhere along it, and some people notice people, but they would never act on it.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,680
Four years later, she realized she was a lesbian.

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,360
My one person I confess to.

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,080
So as I was recalling all these signs, I realized Sam was still talking, and he was telling

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,720
me he felt so much better getting this off his chest, and he'd been wanting to tell me

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,760
for a long time, and he felt so relieved, he kind of wanted to have sex.

42
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,520
And I said, with who?

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
And he said, with you.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,560
And I think he meant it as a compliment, but I have to go to bed and wake up when the bookstores

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
are open.

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:07,800
So the next day, I went directly to the self-help section, where all problems could be solved,

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,080
and there was no book for someone whose husband thought he might be gay.

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
There was a book called Loving Someone Gay, but it turned out to be for teachers and family

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,400
members, but nothing.

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,760
And I was nervous because this is LA, and I didn't want to pioneer a problem.

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,320
This is a very bad sign.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,680
And as I'm looking for a book, any book, I remember I saw one called How to Survive Alien

53
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,920
Abduction, and it wasn't a humor book, it was a serious book with things like block

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,680
their mind control and get help from on high.

55
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,440
And so basically, according to the laws of supply and demand, you're more likely to be

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,960
abducted by an alien than to have your husband realize he's gay.

57
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,120
That's what that said to me.

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,320
And so I left the self-help section despondent and decided that it was time to go to therapy.

59
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,000
Four days now from my high school reunion.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So I went for the first time.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I had never gone to therapy.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,240
I grew up in Oklahoma, which is where my reunion was going to be.

63
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,760
And I went, there was this thing called the Gold Group, because I was in the Writers Guild.

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,040
Basically when I became a comedy writer, I decided my husband no longer wanted to be

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
a straight man.

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
That was basically what happened there.

67
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,680
And so I was in the Writers Guild.

68
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,840
And they paid for this thing called the Gold Group, and it was a group of therapists in

69
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
the valley.

70
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,680
And it was only a $10 copay.

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,000
And it's possible you shouldn't skimp on therapy, but I thought I was going to be in for a while.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,660
So I went to the Gold Group, and I remember when I got in there, you basically get what

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,100
you copay for because I was in this office waiting for my therapist, and I could hear

74
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,180
the session next to me.

75
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,820
It was this paper-thin wall, and I could hear a man sobbing, and I was like, they're going

76
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,280
to hear me sobbing.

77
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,620
And then when my therapist came in, she turned on this little oscillating fan, which I think

78
00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:00,060
is the system the Gold Group had come up with to deal with the soundproofing problem.

79
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,220
And my therapist, and I didn't have anything to compare against, but I just remember noting

80
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,700
she was very badly dressed, like pink and red together and stripes, and I thought she

81
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,180
can't put together an outfit.

82
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,460
And she has to put together my whole life.

83
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,580
This is not good.

84
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,660
And she had all these questions I hadn't even thought of, like, should you be HIV tested

85
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,780
and maybe he's lying and he's been cheating on you?

86
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,780
And she had a lot of anger that we worked on.

87
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,780
So she felt better.

88
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,020
Okay, so I proceeded.

89
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,420
My decision was to go to the reunion with Sam and pretend everything was fine, because

90
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,780
it seemed better than, well, one problem was Sam wasn't ready to come out, because he hadn't

91
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
started.

92
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:52,380
See, when he told me he thought he might be gay, he said, maybe I'll only be 30% gay,

93
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,320
I'll find out, and then I could still be with you.

94
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,620
And I was overwhelmed at the moment, but I do remember thinking, so he'll sleep with

95
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,340
10 men and enjoy three of them?

96
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,700
I'm confused how we're going to do the math of this.

97
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,460
So he hadn't started that experiment yet.

98
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,080
So he wasn't ready to come out, because he didn't know yet.

99
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,460
So we just went to my reunion like that.

100
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,820
So we stayed with my parents, which is not a fun thing, even when your husband doesn't

101
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,300
think he might be gay.

102
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,300
And I remember at the reunion, I won most successful, and I just was like, yeah, my

103
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,300
husband's gay.

104
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,460
You know, it was Oklahoma, the runner-up was, like, the manager of the footlocker, so it

105
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,180
wasn't a huge honor.

106
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,620
But anyway, I remember when I went home, I was really nervous about my mom, because my

107
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,500
mom, it was like being, you know that scene in My Fair Lady when the linguistic experts

108
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
asked her to dance?

109
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,100
That's how it was being alone with my mom with a secret, because my mom, like right

110
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,340
now she would say, your voice sounds a little tight, honey, like she's very eagle-eye about

111
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,140
these emotional things.

112
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,980
And I kept worrying and trying to avoid her, and I completely forgot about my dad.

113
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,460
And at one point, he was sitting there watching ESPN, and he said, is everything okay?

114
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,580
And I said, no, you know, if everything was okay, Sam would be in here watching ESPN with

115
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,100
you instead of in the kitchen flipping through House Beautiful with mom.

116
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,260
And I basically told my dad everything, which is not the system in my house.

117
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,820
You tell my mom, and my mom tells my dad.

118
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,460
But I told my dad.

119
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,700
And then I remembered why I don't ever tell my dad, because he was like, it was like I

120
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,740
was asked, he thought it was as if Sam was asking permission to have an affair and I

121
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
should just say no.

122
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,780
So he's, in fact, his words were, I'd like to sleep with Debbie Reynolds, but your mom's

123
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
not going to let me.

124
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,380
I was like, but what if you want to sleep with Burt Reynolds?

125
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,420
And to his credit, he had no experience with this.

126
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,660
In college, he had had one, you know, there was one guy in his fraternity that everyone

127
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,100
knew had realized he was gay and left his wife and kids, Jerry Hovelman, and no one

128
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,020
had ever heard from him again.

129
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,740
And that was like his whole experience with the gay population.

130
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,260
So he was no help.

131
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,660
And somehow, though, Sam and I survived our my high school reunion, but Mr.

132
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,140
Kaufman, who lived downstairs, did not survive the weekend.

133
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,660
He had died in a sleep of a heart attack and there was a funeral.

134
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,380
And and I remember it was kind of a highlight for me because I had been crying in such

135
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,580
inappropriate places all week.

136
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,140
And finally, I was at a funeral and I could just sob, even though I think it was odd to

137
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,900
people because they were like, is she the tenant?

138
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:36,180
Because I was kind of like grabbing Kleenex from the mother.

139
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:42,980
You know, but I remember I was there with Sam and we were holding hands and we were

140
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,500
thinking I was thinking at least at a funeral, there's a body and a grave and

141
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,180
something tangible to mark the end.

142
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,740
And with the relationship, it's never so clearly marked.

143
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,620
And it was a relief to be there with Sam for closure.

144
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,140
And then it being a Jewish funeral, there was a need for a minion where they needed 10

145
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,060
men to go. And I remember thinking, don't go with the men to Sam.

146
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,940
I do not want him to go with the men.

147
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,540
But then finally, I said go.

148
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,260
And I realized I meant it in the largest sense possible.

149
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:21,140
And about a week later, my dad called me and he said, you know, it's really 99 percent

150
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,940
genetic, this whole homosexuality thing.

151
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,780
And I was completely thrown and thought maybe he'd been on the Internet and researching.

152
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:32,100
And it turned out that my dad had called Jerry Hovelman and asked him to lunch.

153
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,300
He had tracked down this man and took him to Denny's.

154
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,380
And I'm sure there were lots of disclaimers because my dad does not take men to lunch.

155
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,220
So he probably was afraid it would sound like a date or something.

156
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,220
And I'm sure when he showed up in shorts and black dress socks and loafers, it was clear

157
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,900
he was not of the gay persuasion.

158
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:58,220
But he asked Jerry all the things he wanted to ask, I guess, and couldn't like, could

159
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,220
you have avoided this?

160
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,180
And did you ever regret it?

161
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,700
And is your wife OK?

162
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,820
And it was maybe the nicest thing a father ever did, taking Jerry Hovelman to lunch.

163
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,740
And just about a week after that, Sam was finally moving out.

164
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,420
And I remember we were in the top floor of our duplex and downstairs, Mrs.

165
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,500
Kaufman was gardening like she always did.

166
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,700
And Sam hadn't talked to her yet because she was like a parent figure and he still

167
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,980
wasn't ready to come out.

168
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,660
And he wasn't dealing with things as he hadn't dealt with many things.

169
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,540
And so I said, you have to tell her because the moving van is going to be here any

170
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,060
minute and she's going to wonder because and he wouldn't.

171
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,580
So I went downstairs to talk to her.

172
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:41,140
And I remember she was she'd always loved gardening, but it was really about she seemed

173
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,740
more desperate than ever to kind of keep things alive, nurture the living things and

174
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,940
not to let things slip away.

175
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,820
And she couldn't imagine why I was letting my husband slip away.

176
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,460
And I couldn't explain to her.

177
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,700
And so we just sat together on this bench and shoulder to shoulder to women alone,

178
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,580
but not really alone as the moving van lumbered over to the sidewalk.

179
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:01,980
Thank you.

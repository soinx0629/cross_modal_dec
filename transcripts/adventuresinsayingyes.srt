1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
I first started taking care of other people's children

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,560
when I was actually still just a child myself.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,240
So that meant people were paying me basically to play,

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,520
and that was really awesome.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,960
But it also meant that I was getting a ton of childcare experience,

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,880
and that by the time I was 16,

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,320
I probably could make macaroni and cheese with my eyes shut,

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,880
or change a diaper with one hand tied behind my back,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,400
which I only probably ever would have had to do

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,760
with those very naughty Nicholson boys.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,000
But their mother knew they were a handful.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,440
She was paying $10 an hour in 1988.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,680
Laughter

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,560
So I kind of thought that all of my childcare experience

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,120
was going to teach me everything

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,640
that I needed to know about parenting my own children.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,520
And my husband and I, we had a daughter and then a son,

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,600
and then we decided to become foster parents

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,880
with the intention of hopefully being able to adopt one day.

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,800
And you know how everybody always says,

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,960
you need a license to drive a car,

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,640
but you don't need one to have a child?

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,880
That's not true.

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,360
When you become a foster parent, we did have to get a license.

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,080
And so first we had to take these classes

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,320
where they asked us really hard-hitting questions,

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,120
like, is secondhand smoke good or bad?

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,240
Laughter

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,160
Do babies actually need car seats?

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,200
And then we had to do all sorts of other things,

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,880
have physicals done, background checks,

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,720
fingerprinted, have our home inspected, interviews.

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,000
I mean, the whole thing turned out

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,280
to be way more complicated

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,560
than just creating a new human being with my body.

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,160
And then there were all the questions.

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,200
What kind of child would we be willing to take?

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,360
A girl or a boy?

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,200
What race?

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,280
What age?

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,480
Now, I grew up with three sisters,

42
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,320
and I already had one boy

43
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
that I didn't always know how to relate to,

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,840
but then I heard that boys are actually left behind more

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,760
in adoption requests.

46
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,720
So we said that we preferred a boy, any race,

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,560
and having survived two infants already,

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,880
we thought that that pleasure

49
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,040
could be afforded to someone else.

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
So anything up to age four,

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,240
I had a biological son at the time,

52
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,760
and we got our license in the mail,

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,480
and we settled in for what we thought

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
could be a very long wait,

55
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,120
but we got a phone call six weeks later

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,160
about a baby at the hospital,

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,440
and I thought, wow, an infant.

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,360
Doesn't everybody else want an infant?

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,760
Laughter

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,000
But we said yes,

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,680
and when we went to the hospital to pick him up,

62
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,680
the nurses insisted on pushing me out to the car

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,840
in a wheelchair.

64
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,360
Laughter

65
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,640
Which I thought was very funny.

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,120
I mean, I didn't suffer any physical distress

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,920
bringing this kid into the world,

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,520
and even though I thought it was really funny, though,

69
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,120
I realized I was having the same exact,

70
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,520
overwhelmingly surreal sensation

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,600
that I had when I first left the hospital

72
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,680
with my first two babies,

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,440
and that was there's a new person here.

74
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,880
There's this new human being

75
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,200
that's so tiny and perfect and amazing,

76
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,760
and this hospital staff is gonna let us just leave with him

77
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,760
even though they look really competent.

78
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,000
Laughter

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,320
And we got him home,

80
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,000
and it became obvious right away

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,320
that there were things that we still needed to learn

82
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,000
in spite of years of babysitting and parenting experience

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,480
and having a license to parent,

84
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,040
like what to do when a young woman comes bouncing up to you

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
and says, your baby is so cute.

86
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,800
Is his daddy black?

87
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,040
So I just pretended I couldn't really remember.

88
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,400
Laughter

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,240
Or what to do when a woman taps you on the shoulder

90
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,600
at a crowded restaurant and demands to know,

91
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,440
where's that baby from?

92
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,200
And when told, New Jersey,

93
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,120
just continues to keep asking, but where before that?

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,920
But where before that until you're finally

95
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
just forced to say, a uterus?

96
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,680
Laughter

97
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,440
Or what to do when your four-year-old white son

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,680
comes running up and says, we're playing circus,

99
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,720
and the baby has to be the monkey because he's brown,

100
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,960
and your African-American caseworker is visiting,

101
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
and all you can think to do

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
is that you just wanna die on the spot.

103
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,880
And so instead, you just pretend you didn't hear him

104
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,640
and make a strong mental note

105
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
to talk to him about that later.

106
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
I don't think they told us anything

107
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,080
about transracial adoption in those classes.

108
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,800
The most they might have said

109
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
was something along the lines of,

110
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,880
if you're white and have a black child placed with you,

111
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,400
please, for the love of God,

112
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,240
get some help with their skin and hair.

113
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,760
And so I turned to my black friends and I asked for help,

114
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,440
and they helped me, and they also taught me things

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,720
like that my little black boy was only gonna be cute

116
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
in the eyes of the public for a certain age,

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and then he would somehow overnight

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,560
be perceived as threatening to the public

119
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,840
and that it was gonna happen much sooner

120
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,040
than I would anticipate.

121
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,080
And I listened to them and I learned from them,

122
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,680
but I didn't experience any of that harsh reality yet.

123
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,000
And our case moved along

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,560
and we were given the go-ahead to adopt him.

125
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,360
And I got some paperwork in the mail.

126
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,720
It was an adoption subsidy agreement.

127
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,680
And next to the name of our adorable, funny,

128
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,560
very loved and very wanted son

129
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
was the reason for the monthly subsidy

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,200
that he was gonna get.

131
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,600
And it was checked off,

132
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,240
child is hard to place African-American.

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,120
And I felt like I had been punched in the stomach.

134
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,120
And then one day we got a phone call from our caseworker

135
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,200
and I wasn't expecting it,

136
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,560
and I could tell something was up

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,840
and I was right because she said,

138
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,400
do you have room for another baby?

139
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,240
And we weren't really planning on having any more children,

140
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,120
but we loved our little son so much.

141
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,920
We loved any sibling of his.

142
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,680
And so I said, what is it?

143
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,720
And she said, a boy.

144
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,080
And so I cried a little when I said, okay.

145
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,160
And then I said, I guess I better call my husband

146
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
and ask him real quick though.

147
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,720
So then we were up to four children,

148
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,360
one girl and three boys.

149
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,880
And I was pretty sure that I was done with babies.

150
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,880
But then I went to a baby shower

151
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,920
and all the new mom was opening up

152
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,840
all these tiny little socks and really cute onesies

153
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,640
and things and all the women were just gushing.

154
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,480
And I realized that I was sitting like a little bit away

155
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,720
from the rest of them and just thinking

156
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,640
that looks like more laundry to me.

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,680
So then I really knew that I was done with babies

158
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,680
until I get a phone call about our boy's baby sister.

159
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,760
And could we come get her like today?

160
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,120
Did we have a car seat?

161
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,000
And so even though we knew it meant getting on

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,560
another two-year emotional roller coaster,

163
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,920
we borrowed a car seat and said yes.

164
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Six years after starting our fostering experience,

165
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,280
we had adopted each of our children.

166
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,040
We got to say goodbye to the judges and the caseworkers

167
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,800
and good riddance to the one that we referred to

168
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,120
as the anti-social worker.

169
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,120
And hello to the architect and the contractors.

170
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,080
Lessons were still being learned

171
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,920
and mistakes were being made.

172
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,040
I can admit that I have been that white mom

173
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,120
out at the store when a black woman told me

174
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,120
that my baby's hair felt a little bit dry.

175
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,080
And I knew I had to learn from all these different sources,

176
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,600
the black community, adult adoptees,

177
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,400
more experienced transracially adopted families,

178
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,520
and all while trying to balance it

179
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,440
with what it meant to be our family

180
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,520
in this time and in this place.

181
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
And I thought we were doing all right.

182
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,960
And then one day my son was getting ready for school.

183
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,360
He was six years old and getting ready for first grade

184
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,040
and he was brushing his teeth and he just stopped.

185
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,760
And he said, I wish a brown family adopted me.

186
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,080
He wasn't upset.

187
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,720
He was very matter of fact,

188
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,560
like I wanna wear my blue sneakers

189
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,680
and I wish a brown family adopted me.

190
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,600
But I was stunned.

191
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,320
I knew he might say something like that at some point,

192
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,360
but I just wasn't really expecting it.

193
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,760
And so I just tried to stay calm.

194
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,400
And I said, oh, well, how come?

195
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,960
And he said, I want the family to look like me.

196
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,560
And so I pointed out that his younger brother

197
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,840
and sister looked like him.

198
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,400
And he said, yeah, but not the whole family.

199
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,760
And so I just apologized.

200
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,960
I didn't know what else I could possibly do.

201
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,440
And I got him off to school and the whole day

202
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,480
I was thinking, what am I gonna do about this?

203
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,160
And on one hand, I didn't wanna do anything.

204
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,680
I mean, the kid seems fine.

205
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,880
I don't wanna bother him, get him upset about it.

206
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,400
But on the other hand, you have to muddle things up

207
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,680
sometimes before you get some clarity.

208
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,440
So at bedtime that night, I muddled things up

209
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,640
and I asked him, are you still feeling sad

210
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,440
that a Brown family didn't adopt you?

211
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,400
And he didn't say anything, he just nodded yes.

212
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,040
So I said, did anybody do anything

213
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,280
or say something recently that made you start

214
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,200
to feel that way?

215
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,360
And again, he just nodded no.

216
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
So now I'm grasping for straws.

217
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,880
Did you know that daddy and I love you very, very, very,

218
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,520
very much?

219
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,400
And again, just a nod, yes.

220
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,640
I mean, clearly the kid was not gonna help me

221
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,560
move the conversation forward at all.

222
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,320
So I had no idea what to say.

223
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,880
And so I absolutely surprised myself

224
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,000
with what came out next.

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,920
And I said to him, did you know

226
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,120
that there's sadness to adoption?

227
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,880
And this time his interest was piqued

228
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,600
because this time he spoke and he said, no, I didn't.

229
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,240
And I said, well, yeah, most of the time

230
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,960
everybody only talks about how really happy adoption is.

231
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,040
And we are so, so happy that you're part of our family.

232
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,880
But if the world was perfect

233
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
and there were never any problems at all,

234
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,360
you probably could have just stayed with your first mommy.

235
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,320
Don't you think?

236
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,840
And this time my boy answered me.

237
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,000
It wasn't with a nod or with words, but he sobbed.

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,240
It wasn't crying over a skinny,

239
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,200
he was sobbing over an emotional wound

240
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,960
that he didn't know he had.

241
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,200
And he still lacked the emotional maturity

242
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,160
and the language to really explore it.

243
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,600
But there was something about my acknowledging it for him

244
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,200
that just unlocked the deepest sob

245
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,160
I'd ever heard come out of a little child.

246
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,080
And I told him it was okay to be sad about that

247
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,360
and maybe even forever,

248
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,040
but that I wanted to help him find peace over it.

249
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,440
And would he maybe like to try to meet

250
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,000
some more of his birth family?

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,920
And he said, yes.

252
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,040
So I reached out to our last caseworker

253
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,680
and I said, I had heard about this great grandma.

254
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,240
Can you give me her number or something?

255
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,560
And he said, no, I'm actually not allowed to give that out.

256
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,520
So I did a little more asking around and some research

257
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,480
and I found out that he could, however,

258
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,400
send a letter on my behalf.

259
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,600
Now, based on my history with the state,

260
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,560
I didn't really trust that this was gonna happen,

261
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,800
but I had to take a chance.

262
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,880
I wrote the letter and I sent it and hoped for the best.

263
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,600
And it worked because she called us a week or two later,

264
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,520
this great grandmother who had worried about them

265
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,880
and prayed for them for years.

266
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,560
And we went to go meet her immediately.

267
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,640
And as soon as we did, all these doors kept opening

268
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,120
because every time we went,

269
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,720
we just would meet a new family member.

270
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,280
And each one of them welcomed all of us,

271
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,440
our adopted kids, our biological kids,

272
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,520
my husband and myself with open arms.

273
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,920
And all these relationships

274
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,240
that could have felt awkward or strange just never did.

275
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,000
And our children thrived because of it.

276
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,480
And that was four years ago.

277
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,840
And on a more recent visit,

278
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,600
I was sitting catching up with the kids' auntie

279
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,720
like on a couch over here and I could see my husband eating

280
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,140
and talking with another family member over there.

281
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,200
And some of my kids were doing crafts with some cousins

282
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
and others were running around playing Ninja Turtles

283
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,120
with other cousins.

284
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,680
And there was Pop Pop sitting on the couch

285
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,880
and he had the TV on, the nature channel way too loud,

286
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,760
like he always has it and I know that now.

287
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,560
And there was my son just snuggled up by his side

288
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,640
and treating wild animal facts with his grandfather.

289
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,560
And looking around the room that day,

290
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,180
I saw to myself, growing up,

291
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,160
I always thought that adoption just meant a new family

292
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,700
for the children that are adopted.

293
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,060
But looking around here, I know that in our case,

294
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,400
it means so much more because it's a family for all of us.

WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
I reached over and secretly undid my seatbelt.

00:04.480 --> 00:07.420
And when his foot hit the brake at the red light,

00:07.420 --> 00:09.640
I flung open the door and I ran.

00:10.860 --> 00:13.400
I had no shoes on, I was crying.

00:14.380 --> 00:18.500
I had no wallet, but I was okay because I had my cigarettes.

00:20.040 --> 00:21.680
And I didn't want any part of freedom

00:21.680 --> 00:23.260
if I didn't have my cigarettes.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.900
When you live with someone who has a temper,

00:28.820 --> 00:31.740
a very bad temper, a very, very bad temper,

00:31.740 --> 00:35.500
you learn to play around that.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.380
You learn this time I'll play possum

00:38.380 --> 00:41.140
and next time I'll just be real nice

00:41.140 --> 00:42.620
or I'll say yes to everything

00:42.620 --> 00:45.820
or you make yourself scarce or you run.

00:45.820 --> 00:48.380
And this was one of the times when you just run.

00:49.620 --> 00:51.460
And as I was running, I thought

00:51.460 --> 00:53.200
this was a great place to jump out

00:53.200 --> 00:55.340
because they were big lawns and they were cul-de-sacs

00:55.340 --> 00:56.820
and sometimes he would come after me

00:56.820 --> 01:00.060
and drive and yell stuff at me to get back in, get back in.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.140
And I was like, no, I'm out of here.

01:02.140 --> 01:04.300
This is great and I went and hid behind a cabana

01:04.300 --> 01:07.460
and he left and I had my cigarettes.

01:07.460 --> 01:11.320
And I started to walk in this beautiful neighborhood.

01:11.320 --> 01:16.320
It was 10.30 at night and it was silent and lovely

01:17.740 --> 01:22.600
and there was no sound except for sprinklers.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.600
Ch, ch, ch, ch, prrrr, ch, ch, ch, ch.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.100
Prrrr, and I was enjoying myself

01:30.100 --> 01:31.500
and enjoying the absence of anger

01:31.500 --> 01:34.900
and enjoying these few hours I knew I'd have of freedom.

01:34.900 --> 01:39.620
And just to perfect it, I thought I'll have a smoke

01:39.620 --> 01:42.780
and then it occurred to me with horrifying speed,

01:42.780 --> 01:43.900
I don't have a light.

01:46.420 --> 01:50.500
Just then, as if an answer, I see a figure up ahead.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.820
Who is that?

01:51.820 --> 01:53.180
It's not him, okay?

01:53.180 --> 01:54.740
They don't have a dog, who is that?

01:55.020 --> 01:57.500
What are they doing out on this suburban street?

01:57.500 --> 02:00.660
And the person comes closer and I can see it's a woman.

02:00.660 --> 02:03.900
And then I can see, she has her hands in her face.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.020
Oh, she's crying.

02:05.020 --> 02:07.620
And then she sees me and she composes herself

02:07.620 --> 02:10.700
and she gets closer and I see she has no shoes on.

02:10.700 --> 02:12.580
She has no shoes on and she's crying

02:12.580 --> 02:15.240
and she's out on this strange street.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.340
I recognize her, though I've never met her.

02:18.340 --> 02:22.180
And just as she passes me, she says, you got a cigarette?

02:22.180 --> 02:23.660
And I say, you got a light?

02:25.140 --> 02:27.300
And she says, damn, I hope so.

02:27.300 --> 02:30.780
And then first she digs into her cutoffs in the front,

02:30.780 --> 02:32.380
nothing, and then digs in the back

02:32.380 --> 02:33.820
and then she has this vest on

02:33.820 --> 02:35.740
that has 50 million little pockets on it

02:35.740 --> 02:37.860
and she's checking and checking and it's looking bad.

02:37.860 --> 02:39.020
It's looking very bad.

02:40.340 --> 02:43.360
She digs back in the front again, deep, deep,

02:43.360 --> 02:45.620
and she pulls out a pack of matches

02:45.620 --> 02:47.460
that have been laundered at least once.

02:49.620 --> 02:52.300
We open it up and there is one match inside.

02:53.180 --> 02:54.740
Okay, oh my God.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.540
This takes on, it's like Nassau now.

02:56.540 --> 02:58.380
We gotta like, how are we gonna do it?

02:58.380 --> 03:01.620
Okay, and we hunker down, we crouch on the ground

03:01.620 --> 03:04.260
and where's the wind coming from?

03:04.260 --> 03:05.100
We're stopping.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.100
I take out my cigarettes, let's get the cigarettes ready.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.660
Oh, my brand, she says, not surprising.

03:09.660 --> 03:12.200
And we both have our cigarettes at the ready.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.980
She strikes once, nothing.

03:13.980 --> 03:16.580
She strikes again, yes, fire.

03:16.580 --> 03:20.500
Puff, inhale, sweet kiss of that cigarette.

03:20.660 --> 03:23.820
And we sit there and we're loving the nicotine

03:23.820 --> 03:25.940
and we both need this right now.

03:25.940 --> 03:28.380
I can tell, the night's been tough.

03:28.380 --> 03:29.900
Immediately we start to reminisce

03:29.900 --> 03:31.780
about our 30 second relationship.

03:31.780 --> 03:33.700
I didn't think that was gonna happen, me neither.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.380
Oh, man, that was close.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.300
Oh, I'm so lucky I saw you, yeah.

03:39.580 --> 03:43.500
Then she surprises me by saying, what was the fight about?

03:44.460 --> 03:46.700
And I say, what are they all about?

03:46.700 --> 03:48.000
And she said, I know what you mean.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.580
She said, was it a bad one?

03:49.620 --> 03:51.380
And I said, you know, like medium.

03:52.220 --> 03:56.340
She said, oh, and we start to trade stories about our lives.

03:56.340 --> 03:58.400
We're both from up north.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.940
We're both kind of newish to the neighborhood.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.340
This is in Florida.

04:02.340 --> 04:04.700
We both went to college, not grade colleges,

04:04.700 --> 04:06.520
but man, we graduated.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.740
And I'm actually finding myself a little jealous of her

04:08.740 --> 04:11.840
because she has this really cool job washing dogs.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.700
She had horses back home and she really loves animals

04:16.700 --> 04:17.620
and she wants to be a vet.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.460
I'm like, man, you're halfway there.

04:21.900 --> 04:24.540
I'm a waitress at an ice cream parlor.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.340
So that's not, I don't know where I want to be,

04:26.340 --> 04:28.480
but I know it's not that.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.300
And then it gets a little deeper

04:30.300 --> 04:33.400
and we share some other stuff about what our lives are like.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.580
Things that I can't ever tell people at home.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.660
This girl, I can tell her the really ugly stuff

04:39.660 --> 04:42.940
and she still understands how it can still be pretty.

04:42.940 --> 04:45.960
She understands like how nice he's gonna be

04:45.960 --> 04:48.620
when I get home and how sweet that'll be.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.320
We are chain smoking off each other.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.560
Oh, that's almost out, come on.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.760
And we go through this entire pack until it's gone.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.720
And then I say, you know what, this is a little funny,

04:59.720 --> 05:01.800
but you're gonna have to show me the way to get home.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.160
Because although I'm 23 years old,

05:03.160 --> 05:04.960
I don't have my driver's license yet.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.600
And I just jumped out right when I needed to.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.560
And she says, well, why don't you come back to my house

05:09.560 --> 05:11.320
and I'll give you a ride.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.840
I said, okay, great.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.200
And we start walking.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.720
And we get to this, lots of lights

05:18.720 --> 05:21.200
and the roads are getting wider and wider

05:21.200 --> 05:22.400
and there's more cars.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.160
And I see lots of stores, you know, laundry mats

05:26.160 --> 05:29.120
and dollar stores and emergency centers.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.120
And then we cross over US-1

05:33.120 --> 05:37.420
and she leads me to someplace and I think, no.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.380
But yes, Carl's Efficiency Apartments.

05:41.380 --> 05:42.580
This girl lives there.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.440
And it's horrible and it's lit up so bright

05:45.440 --> 05:47.800
just to illuminate the horribleness of it.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.640
It's the kind of place where you drive your car right up

05:49.640 --> 05:51.000
and the door's right there.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.240
And there's 50 million cigarette butts outside.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.000
And there's like doors one through seven

05:55.000 --> 05:56.400
and you know behind every single door

05:56.400 --> 05:58.880
there's some horrible misery going on.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.800
There's someone crying or drunk or lonely or cruel.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.400
And I think, oh, she lives here, how awful.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.160
We go to the door, door number four,

06:08.160 --> 06:11.420
and she very, very quietly keys in.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.540
As soon as the door opens,

06:13.540 --> 06:15.260
I hear the blare of television come out

06:15.260 --> 06:17.180
and on the blue light of the television,

06:17.180 --> 06:20.900
the smoke of 100 cigarettes in that little crack of light.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.860
And I hear the man and he says, where were you?

06:23.860 --> 06:26.060
And she says, nevermind, I'm back.

06:26.060 --> 06:29.020
And he says, you all right?

06:29.020 --> 06:30.140
And she says, yeah, I'm all right.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.060
And then she turns to me and says, you want a beer?

06:32.060 --> 06:33.780
And he says, who the fuck is that?

06:34.780 --> 06:37.500
And she pulls me over and he sees me and he says,

06:37.500 --> 06:39.540
oh, hey, I'm not a threat.

06:40.540 --> 06:43.300
Just then he takes a drag of his cigarette,

06:43.300 --> 06:45.140
a very hard, hard drag, you know,

06:45.140 --> 06:47.300
the kind that makes the end of it really heat up,

06:47.300 --> 06:49.820
hot, hot, hot and long and it's a little scary.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.580
And I follow the cigarette down

06:52.580 --> 06:54.860
because I'm afraid of that head falling off.

06:54.860 --> 06:58.440
And I'm surprised when I see in the crook of his arm,

06:58.440 --> 07:02.100
a little boy sleeping, a toddler.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.900
And I think, and just then the girl reaches

07:04.900 --> 07:07.060
underneath the bed and takes out a carton

07:07.060 --> 07:10.460
and she taps out the last pack of cigarettes in there.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.700
And on the way up, she kisses the little boy

07:12.700 --> 07:14.820
and then she kisses the man and the man says again,

07:14.820 --> 07:16.300
you all right?

07:16.300 --> 07:18.060
And she says, yeah, I'm just gonna go out

07:18.060 --> 07:19.700
and smoke with her.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.340
And so we go outside and sit amongst the cigarette butts

07:22.340 --> 07:26.420
and smoke and I say, wow, that's your little boy.

07:26.420 --> 07:27.900
She says, yeah, isn't he beautiful?

07:27.900 --> 07:31.100
And I say, yeah, he is, he is beautiful.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.460
He's my light, he keeps me going, she says.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.900
We finish our cigarettes.

07:37.740 --> 07:39.140
She finishes her beer, I don't have a beer

07:39.140 --> 07:41.340
because I can't go home with beer on my breath.

07:42.780 --> 07:47.380
And she goes inside to get the keys.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.340
She takes too long in there getting the keys

07:49.340 --> 07:51.300
and I think something must be wrong

07:51.300 --> 07:54.300
and she comes out and she says, look, I'm really sorry

07:54.300 --> 07:57.000
but we don't have any gas in the car,

07:57.000 --> 07:58.640
it's already on E and he needs to get to work

07:58.640 --> 08:02.700
in the morning and I'm gonna walk to work as it is.

08:02.700 --> 08:03.820
So what I did was though, here look,

08:03.820 --> 08:05.660
I drew out this map for you and you're really,

08:05.660 --> 08:07.220
you're like a mile and a half from home

08:07.220 --> 08:08.860
and if you walk three streets over,

08:08.860 --> 08:10.140
you'll be back on that pretty street

08:10.140 --> 08:11.780
and you just take that and you'll be fine.

08:11.780 --> 08:15.160
And she also has wrapped up in toilet paper,

08:15.160 --> 08:19.080
seven cigarettes for me, a third of her pack, I note,

08:19.080 --> 08:20.640
and a new pack of matches.

08:21.660 --> 08:25.140
And she tells me goodbye and that was great to meet you

08:25.140 --> 08:30.140
and how lucky and that was fun and let's be friends.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.300
And I say, yeah, okay, and I walk away

08:33.300 --> 08:35.500
but I kinda know we're not gonna be friends.

08:36.820 --> 08:40.740
I might not ever see her again and I kinda know,

08:40.740 --> 08:43.500
I don't think she's ever gonna be a vet.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.940
And I cross and I walk away and maybe this would've seemed

08:46.940 --> 08:49.420
like a visit from my possible future and scary

08:49.420 --> 08:51.780
but it kinda does the opposite on the walk home.

08:51.780 --> 08:55.740
I'm like, man, that was really grim over there.

08:55.740 --> 09:00.060
And I'm going home now to my nice boyfriend

09:00.060 --> 09:02.740
and he is gonna be so extra happy to see me

09:02.740 --> 09:05.500
and we have a one bedroom apartment

09:05.500 --> 09:08.900
and we have two trees and there's a yard

09:08.900 --> 09:10.500
and we have this jar in the kitchen

09:10.500 --> 09:12.580
where there's like loose money that we can use for anything

09:12.580 --> 09:14.540
like we would never ever run out of gas

09:14.540 --> 09:16.760
and I don't have a baby, you know?

09:16.760 --> 09:19.480
So I can leave whenever I want.

09:21.020 --> 09:24.260
I smoked all seven cigarettes on the way home

09:24.260 --> 09:27.180
and people who have never smoked cigarettes

09:27.180 --> 09:31.000
just think, ick, disgusting and poison.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.760
But unless you've had them and held them dear,

09:34.760 --> 09:36.700
you don't know how great they can be

09:36.700 --> 09:40.100
and what friends and comfort and kinship they can bring.

09:41.120 --> 09:45.800
It took me a long time to quit that boyfriend

09:46.960 --> 09:49.280
and then to quit smoking.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.520
And sometimes I still miss the smoking.

09:53.300 --> 09:57.260
Then I stay away from him because of the work and the pain.

09:57.260 --> 10:20.840
And even the

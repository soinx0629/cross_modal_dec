1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
In all honesty, I'm going to start

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,140
by admitting that I sometimes lie.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,060
Occasionally, I'll include a lie in a story

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,420
I'm telling if I think it'll make the story better.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,340
I don't do it to protect the innocent,

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,840
because I don't know any stories where

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,300
the people in them are innocent.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,180
And I don't do it to be shocking either,

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,020
though I admit to once telling a story where I exaggerated

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,220
the length of my penis.

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,020
In my own defense, I exaggerated down and not up.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,640
And I did it for the laugh.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,160
The story I'm telling you tonight does not have a lie in it,

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,800
or many laughs for that matter.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,880
When I'm done telling you this story, you may think

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,400
it's nothing but a lie, but I'd ask you to trust me on this.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,240
At the age of 19, I fell prey to a powerful and deeply

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,400
corrupting influence.

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,840
It dogged me for six years, costing me many a friend,

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,520
and in the process bringing my family to ruin.

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,460
It crippled me to such an extent that I

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,740
have spent the intervening 15 years recovering from it.

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,420
The influence I speak of is hope.

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,500
Now, you should know at the get go,

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,860
there's nothing in my childhood to suggest

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,220
I might find myself on such a wayward path as that.

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,100
My parents loved me terribly.

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,500
They taught me right from wrong.

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,500
They taught me to be courageous in the face of bullies.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,960
They taught me patience and forgiveness.

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,100
They taught me that love would see you

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,220
through any misfortune.

33
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,540
My trouble began on Independence Day.

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,380
Not the Independence Day, but my Independence Day.

35
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,660
My Independence Day occurred on Memorial Day, 1982.

36
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,100
That was the day I told my family I was gay.

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,460
The act itself, mom, dad, I'm gay,

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,420
was relatively unexceptional.

39
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,380
In fact, it should have been more exceptional,

40
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,180
and I've always sort of wished that it had been.

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,520
However, subsequent events overshadowed it,

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,280
and it pales by comparison.

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,400
The subsequent events occurred in my absence,

44
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,360
after the fact, as I was in my car driving back to college

45
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,560
to take my final freshman exams.

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
I remember being on the highway and thinking

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,960
how I kind of expected my parents to freak out a little.

48
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,400
And to my surprise, they had not freaked out.

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
They'd been calm and cool and collected,

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,500
oddly calm, cool, and collected.

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,520
But still, I was really happy as I drove back to school.

52
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,020
Meanwhile, subsequent events were

53
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,460
busy unfolding back home.

54
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,020
My mother was going through the house where I grew up

55
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,820
and was gathering together things I had made for her.

56
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,620
A jewelry box when I was in 4-H, and a painting when I was 16.

57
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,440
A box containing the letters that I'd

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,020
written them from school, which I used to do every week.

59
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,940
She was removing photographs from the walls

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,460
and placing them in little piles around the house.

61
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,780
And she was directing my father, who never dared not follow

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,400
her direction, to take the bed and the desk and the chair

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,880
and the lamp and the Smith Corona, Smith Corona even,

64
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,480
and to put them all in the front yard next to the rock garden,

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,240
not too close to the maple tree.

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,360
My clothes, my books, my bookcases, my report cards,

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,920
my Farrah Fawcett posters, my shoes,

68
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,760
three years worth of interview magazines,

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,160
the good ones with the Andy Warhol covers, everything.

70
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,020
Then with my brother and my sister and my grandparents

71
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,420
watching, my mother removed a cigarette

72
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,260
from this tiny crocheted case she always kept them in.

73
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,780
And she lit the cigarette, and then she took the match

74
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,780
and put it to the pile of things there in the front yard that

75
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,720
contained the sole and complete record of my existence

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,380
and my family.

77
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,860
It burned for 7 and 1 half hours,

78
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,020
thanks in part to the addition of some lighter fluid

79
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,060
to help get the larger pieces of furniture going.

80
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,280
All of it, all that was me prior to that memorable Memorial

81
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
Day up in flames.

82
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,240
According to my sister, who years later recounted

83
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,440
these details to me, it was a mighty impressive blaze.

84
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,240
In their eagerness to feed it, and due to an unexpected wind

85
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,280
off the fields around the house, the sugar maple

86
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,880
that was older than my great grandfather

87
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,160
caught a spark in its branches and was sacrificed.

88
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,920
They cut off all communication with me.

89
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,320
They emptied and closed our joint bank account.

90
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,040
There goes college.

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,480
They barred the door.

92
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,160
They stopped talking, stopped answering my letters,

93
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,280
stopped taking my calls.

94
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,920
They stopped anything with me.

95
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,560
They just stopped.

96
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,320
I was completely disbelieving.

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,200
I mean, this didn't make any sense.

98
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,120
All of my friends had stories about telling

99
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,160
their families they were gay, and they all ended the same way.

100
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,280
Sooner or later, everything worked out fine.

101
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,540
So I even had a friend named Neil,

102
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,260
whose parents had done the same thing.

103
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,500
At first, they just stopped talking to him.

104
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,220
But one year later, they were inviting his new boyfriend

105
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,020
to come home with him for the holidays.

106
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,780
Everyone counseled me to have a little patience

107
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,140
and have a little hope.

108
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,300
And this is how it starts, slowly, just a little hope,

109
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,380
just enough to get you through.

110
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,420
But hope is cumulative.

111
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,500
A little bit here and a little bit there,

112
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,120
it builds up in the system until it becomes something toxic.

113
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,920
Denial.

114
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,440
I mean, their reaction had been, yes, extreme,

115
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,480
but not the worst that could happen.

116
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,280
The thing to do was to be a good son, to make them proud,

117
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,120
to earn back their love.

118
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,360
So I got a job, and then another, and then a third.

119
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,760
Three shifts, three restaurants, six days a week.

120
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,520
That would show them.

121
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
But they weren't watching.

122
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,980
I wrote them letters, lots of letters, about nothing.

123
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,100
It's Tuesday, and it's hot.

124
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,060
Or my new roommate is named Kathy.

125
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,740
Or my friends took me out for my birthday yesterday.

126
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,060
They didn't write back.

127
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,820
Living, for me, sort of came to a halt,

128
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,260
despite the fact that my life just went on and on.

129
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,580
I didn't think about my future.

130
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,860
I didn't think about my needs.

131
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,380
I didn't think about my sadness.

132
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,540
I didn't think about any of it.

133
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,100
I didn't have to, because I had hope.

134
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,700
Every day, whispering in my ear, don't give up.

135
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,800
Don't walk away.

136
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
You're almost there.

137
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,720
Don't stop.

138
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,360
Don't grow.

139
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,680
Don't develop.

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,640
Don't worry.

141
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,040
Just don't make any sudden movements, or you'll blow it.

142
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,480
So six years went on like this, without a word from them.

143
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,920
So finally, hurt and confused beyond my ability

144
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,960
to hold it in, and frankly, finding it really

145
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,440
difficult to maintain the illusion

146
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,120
that this was temporary.

147
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:50,740
I decided to make one more attempt to force the issue.

148
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,980
So I flew home and showed up unannounced at my mother's

149
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,700
office.

150
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,940
It was an amazing visit.

151
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,180
I asked the receptionist to page my mother

152
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,060
and tell her she had a surprise visitor.

153
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,860
And I stood there in the lobby, and I

154
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,180
remember seeing my mother come down this long hallway

155
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,740
toward me.

156
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,260
And she was walking, and then she sort of looked up,

157
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,260
and she saw me.

158
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,900
And then she recognized who it was,

159
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,180
and she turned and walked away again.

160
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,020
It was a really amazing 90-second visit.

161
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,060
Two and a half weeks later, a black funeral wreath

162
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,120
was delivered to me at my office with a note that

163
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,040
said, in memory of our son.

164
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,720
Clearly, it was time to give up hope and take up therapy.

165
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,680
So I talked to a counselor who asked me

166
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,720
why I had invited this turmoil into my life.

167
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,440
I talked to a minister who suggested a Christian youth

168
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,940
camp.

169
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,860
I talked to a lesbian who offered

170
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,700
to slash my mother's tires if I paid for her flight there.

171
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,240
I signed up for scream therapy, where

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,700
I beat pillows with tennis rackets

173
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,740
and screamed obscenities and pulled

174
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,180
a muscle in my shoulder.

175
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,260
Mostly I talked to friends, and mostly the pain persisted.

176
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,060
The sheer weight of it nearly crushed me,

177
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,740
or at least that's how it felt at the time.

178
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,700
Since it was my constant companion,

179
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,620
I spent most of my time turning it over in my mind,

180
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,120
fingering it like some sort of psychological worry stone.

181
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,680
Over the years, it's been eroded by so much handling.

182
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,500
All that remains now is a small, hard, nearly weightless pebble,

183
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,920
really.

184
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,680
Worn away is most of the anger and much of the hurt.

185
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,540
But one question remains.

186
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,420
How was it possible that they taught me

187
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,300
love and loyalty in excess of that which they themselves

188
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,800
possessed?

189
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,500
I have come to believe that it's not

190
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,580
possible to understand what they did.

191
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,900
Not possible for me, anyway.

192
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,060
To understand it would seem to indicate

193
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,820
that there was some justification for it,

194
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,020
and I know for certain that there is not.

195
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,900
Still, there's no escaping my parents.

196
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,100
This thing they did, this extreme and unfathomable

197
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,340
and many layered thing they did, tore a hole

198
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,420
in the middle of my life.

199
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,460
I have spent years and a lot of money

200
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,860
darning that hole while trying to keep the rest of my world

201
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,020
from unraveling.

202
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,500
And yet, their influence on me is enduring.

203
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,020
My parents loved me terribly.

204
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,940
I have been courageous in the face of bullies.

205
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,860
There is such a thing as too much patience,

206
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,660
but no such thing as too much forgiveness.

207
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,220
And love has seen me through every misfortune.

208
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,780
Thank you.

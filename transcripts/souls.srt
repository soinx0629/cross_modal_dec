1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
So a lot of people are raised with a religion, and I'm one of those people that was raised

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,520
with two.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,160
There was our official religion.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,080
My family is, and I was at the time, conservative evangelical Christians.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:27,280
But then there was our unofficial faith and hope we had in Mary Kay cosmetics.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,680
Many of the women in my family had been Mary Kay beauty consultants since I was a child,

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:40,520
and I loved Jesus as long as I could remember, but that Mary Kay thing, I was hoping to dodge

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,800
that bullet.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,400
I was this brainy grunge girl from Boulder County.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,680
I wore hemp jewelry and clothes from the Salvation Army.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,760
I had moral objections to wearing makeup, and when I got a scholarship to go out of

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,520
state for college, I thought I'd made my big escape.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,480
But my last visit home, I listened to one recruiting tape too many, and the logic and

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,960
reason finally got to me, and I signed the dotted line, and I started my business as

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,680
a Mary Kay beauty consultant.

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,040
Now on paper, the business plan looks foolproof.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,240
All you're supposed to need is to have one friend to host a party for you, where you

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,080
sell skin care and makeup to her friends, and then you're supposed to book two more

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,760
every time, so your date book is never empty.

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,000
But I could never book two more.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,520
I used the script I thought I was fun to be with.

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,560
I don't know what the problem was, but luckily for me, there was like a hundred other ways

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,800
they trained us to get bookings, and one of these ways was to strike up seemingly natural

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,480
conversations with perfect strangers.

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,000
And we had a name for this.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,800
We called this warm chatter.

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,800
And I thought, damn it, I am going to rock this.

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,280
I'm going to be the queen of warm chatter.

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,720
So what I'm about to tell you, I did this for a very long time, about two or three days

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,600
a week for two or three hours a day.

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,000
I would get dressed up in my business suit, and I'd put on all my makeup, and I'd pack

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,240
my bag full of samples, and I would drive to Target.

33
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,480
And in Target, I would get my red shopping cart, and I would pretend I was shopping for

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,360
items, but really, I was just hunting for women.

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,180
I was looking for women who looked cute or friendly or approachable.

36
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:50,100
When I found somebody like this, then I would just discreetly follow her through the store

37
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:57,580
until we could be together in an aisle alone.

38
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:06,420
And then I would appear to just be walking by normally, and I would slow down, and in

39
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,140
the most casual way possible, I would say these words that I had rehearsed a hundred

40
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
million times.

41
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,420
I would say, excuse me, can I ask you a quick question?

42
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,460
I'm Jen with Mary Kay, and we just came out with a new line of lip glosses, and I need

43
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,020
some women's opinions of it.

44
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,600
You know, I have some samples here in my bag.

45
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,420
Is there any reason why you wouldn't want to take one home and try it?

46
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,900
And this part was really important.

47
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,740
We are trained to smile and nod while we ask the question.

48
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,340
It has to do with the nonverbal communication.

49
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,900
In mirroring, it's very advanced.

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,780
And if she said yes, I'd give her the sample, I'd get her phone number.

51
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,140
When I called her back later to thank her, I would offer her a complimentary appointment

52
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,140
with me.

53
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,980
And I wouldn't mention that all my appointments were complimentary, because it just didn't

54
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,780
seem important.

55
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,660
So at the same time I was doing this for my career, my husband and I were also helping

56
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,420
to lead programs for our local church.

57
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,180
And this was the kind of church that was trying to be really hip and modern.

58
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,700
It met in a strip mall, and we had a rock band, a rock band leading worship up front.

59
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,100
The pastor was this 40-somethings British guy, and he really wanted to attract 20-somethings,

60
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,100
so we were a hot commodity.

61
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,100
We were right in the demographic.

62
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,780
And we started to get promoted up into higher and higher echelons of leadership.

63
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,460
So we were invited to the leadership team meeting and then the core leadership team

64
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,460
meeting.

65
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,980
And I still remember my first night at one of these meetings, and I don't know exactly

66
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,260
what I was expecting, but I think I'd always imagine them to be kind of soulful events.

67
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,500
And I was really dismayed to show up and discover it was this really tedious conversation about

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,340
branding and marketing and what the church's next advertising campaign was going to be.

69
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,020
So it didn't take too long before these two worlds, the church and Mary Kay, started to

70
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,420
look more and more similar.

71
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,420
They both had the lure, and Mary Kay was giving out free samples, but at the church we were

72
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,740
having free events to try and get people in the doors.

73
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,140
In both worlds, we were couching everything we did inside a conversation about service.

74
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,860
So Mary Kay's company tagline at the time was, changing women's lives, which if you

75
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,820
think about it, isn't that different from saving people's souls?

76
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,740
And we really believed it.

77
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,420
We really thought we were doing this, even though nobody's motives are that pure.

78
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,500
And in both worlds, I was being trained all the time to listen to people everywhere I

79
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,300
went for whatever was missing or not working about their life and offer what we had as

80
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,140
the solution.

81
00:05:53,140 --> 00:06:00,100
So if you needed time or money or flexibility, Mary Kay might be perfect for you, but if

82
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,380
you're struggling with your marriage or you've had a recent loss, maybe you're questioning

83
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,780
the meaning of life, call me crazy, but have you considered maybe Jesus is the answer?

84
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,500
And soon I just started to feel like a 24-hour saleswoman, and it started to get confusing

85
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:25,260
I was wearing at which time until one day I was in Target with my little red cart, and

86
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,620
I saw this lovely-looking redhead who smiled so big when I smiled at her, and I started

87
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,980
into my script.

88
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,740
Excuse me, can I ask you a quick question?

89
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,520
Except this time it starts to sound kind of flat, like those pull-string dolls that sound

90
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,040
kind of wonky at the end.

91
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,080
And suddenly I was just thinking, does she need Mary Kay or does she need Jesus?

92
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Does she need Mary Kay or does she need Jesus?

93
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:07,600
And I don't know which one I offered her, but she said no, because I was acting crazy.

94
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:15,360
And she turned and walked away, and I realized the problem with whenever you have something,

95
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,360
whether it's a religion or a business or anything else that you think is the right answer for

96
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,440
everybody, through that lens you can't help but look at everyone in the world as if they're

97
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,280
broken and need to be fixed, and I didn't want to do that anymore.

98
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,080
So I put my cart away at the front of the store and I drove home.

99
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,800
The next night was my weekly success meeting, and the director was up front telling us,

100
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,940
giving us all the information about the new lipstick formula and the changes that were

101
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,360
being made, and I started to look around the room at these women, and they were either

102
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,620
my friends who I recruited into it or my relatives who had recruited me into it, and I was thinking

103
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:06,000
about how devastating it would be when I quit, because I wasn't just rejecting everything

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,840
they stood for, but I was letting down my friends, I was bailing on them, and then my

105
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,280
relatives, the people who had recruited me, their income depended on me.

106
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,320
Their income, their status, all of our fortunes were tied in together.

107
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,600
And I thought, but is this really changing women's lives the way I hoped it would?

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,320
And the director started passing around mirrors and lipstick samples for us to try it ourselves,

109
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,240
and I thought, no, I don't think so anymore.

110
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,120
And a couple days later was the church leadership meeting, and the pastor was telling us that

111
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,120
the church's new mission statement needed to have five points, one for every finger

112
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,760
on the hand, so people could remember it.

113
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,320
And I started looking around this room and thinking about what they would think about

114
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,840
me when I quit.

115
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,200
They would think I was backsliding and falling off the wagon, but it was even worse than

116
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
that.

117
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,680
They would think I was going to hell, that my children were going to hell, and if I was

118
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,560
wrong, maybe they would be right.

119
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,520
And I thought, but is this really saving people's souls, this, all this that we're doing?

120
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,760
And the pastor interrupted to say that all five points needed to start with the same

121
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,320
letter.

122
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:36,880
And I thought, no, I don't think so anymore.

123
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,080
And so that was when I stopped trying to save the world, and I decided to save myself instead

124
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,160
from this life I didn't want anymore.

125
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,920
And it really cost me.

126
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,900
I lost my identity.

127
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,760
I lost belonging.

128
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,880
I lost the ability to ever be that certain or righteous about anything ever again.

129
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,480
And if you can imagine what it's like to lose a faith, and then imagine what it's like to

130
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,640
lose two at once, because even though Mary Kay was a business, it wasn't just that, it

131
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,960
was a way I thought the world worked.

132
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,520
It's a way I thought that we could all win and everybody could get what they needed.

133
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,160
It was really devastating.

134
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,120
I felt like I might not ever be able to trust myself again.

135
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,320
The last piece of our exit strategy was our move to New York.

136
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,480
We were going to get geographic distance, start fresh someplace else.

137
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,720
We landed in Brooklyn in a neighborhood called Park Slope.

138
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,400
And everywhere we went, people were either trying to recruit us into or warn us against

139
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,840
joining the Park Slope food co-op.

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,680
And it seemed so unobjectionable, you know?

141
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:10,400
Like who can argue against cheap, organic, environmentally friendly food, community run?

142
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,840
And part of me was really tempted, because I thought I can have my identity back.

143
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,720
Everyone will know I'm a good person.

144
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,960
And I can belong again.

145
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,040
But there was something about the way that the people we talked to were just so convinced

146
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:35,040
it was the right thing for everybody that felt creepily familiar.

147
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,400
And I thought, I know where that path leads.

148
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,960
So when one particularly zealous friend cornered me one day and said, are you going to join

149
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,120
or not?

150
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,080
Are you in or are you out?

151
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:58,880
I just took a deep breath and I looked her in the eyes and I said, sorry, I don't do

152
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,640
religions anymore.

153
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Thank you.

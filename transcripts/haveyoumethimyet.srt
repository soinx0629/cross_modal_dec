1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In 2008, I was one of those young people who became obsessed with Barack Obama.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,760
I was a senior in college at the time, and after I graduated, I drove out to Ohio and

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,600
I worked on his campaign.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,580
And after the campaign, I drove to Washington because hope and change.

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,140
And two years later, the White House actually hired me.

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,740
They hired me to write speeches.

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,180
And people would hear about my new job and they would say, wow, you must be really good.

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,500
And I'd say, I don't know, I hope so.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,500
And they thought I was pretending to be humble, but I was entirely sincere.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,700
It's not that I didn't think I had any talent whatsoever, it's just that I knew there are

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:03,860
300 million people in America, and some of them are babies, but a lot of them are adults.

12
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:12,060
And it just seemed unlikely that I was the best we the people could do.

13
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,060
So every day, I walked through the gates of the White House absolutely sure somebody had

14
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,900
made a mistake.

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,860
And while this was going on, my friends and family were equally sure they now had direct

16
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,580
access to the President of the United States.

17
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,040
Like I'm sitting in my White House office and I get a text from my sister, Rebecca,

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,060
and it says, how come the Department of Homeland Security doesn't have a mailing address?

19
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,540
Now even in the best of circumstances, this is a disturbing question to get from a family

20
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,880
member.

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,920
And if you work in the White House, you want to know the answer to this kind of stuff,

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,560
and I have no idea.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,240
And it's like this with everything.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,720
I mean, suddenly everyone has a law that only I can get through Congress.

25
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,280
Everybody has something wrong with Obamacare that I need to know about.

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,320
Mostly everybody has the same question.

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,960
They all want to know, have you met him yet?

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,880
Have you met Obama yet?

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,320
And I say, no, I haven't met him yet, and I get this look.

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,640
And it's a look I soon learned means you may be 24 years old and working at the White

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,360
House, but you're still a disappointment to your family and friends.

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
And I have to say, I totally get it.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,440
I mean, everybody thinks that the White House is either like the TV show The West Wing where

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,800
everyone's hanging out with the President, or it's like the TV show Scandal where everyone's

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,100
having sex with the President.

36
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,560
But if you're looking for a Hollywood analogy, the White House is like the Death Star.

37
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,840
What I mean by that is just that there's thousands of people, they run around the hallways,

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,440
they're all just trying to make sure their little bit of their job works well.

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,280
And just because Darth Vader is the public face of the organization, it doesn't mean

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,560
that every stormtrooper gets personal one-on-one time.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,080
So I try to explain this whole Death Star thing, and it doesn't work.

42
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,760
I still get that disappointed look.

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,920
And frankly, nobody's more disappointed than I am.

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,620
I mean, nobody wants me to meet the President more than me.

45
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,860
And there's two reasons for this.

46
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,780
The first is kind of corny, but it's true.

47
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,460
I moved to Washington because I thought, I don't know what it is, but there must be something

48
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,420
I can do for my country.

49
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,000
I want to be the kind of person where the President of the United States is just a little

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,860
bit better at his job because I'm in the room.

51
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,900
And the second reason is I would really like Barack Obama and I to become best friends.

52
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,940
Now, I'm not saying that every White House staffer imagined that they would become buddies

53
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
with the President.

54
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,980
I'm just saying that none of us ruled it out.

55
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,600
Like you would hear these stories.

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,460
Somebody got a fist bump in the hallway or someone else got invited up to play cards

57
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,340
on Air Force One.

58
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,120
And the moral was always the same.

59
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,380
Any moment could be the moment that changes your life forever.

60
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,500
Now my first chance at a life-changing moment came in November 2011 when I was asked to

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,380
write the Thanksgiving video address.

62
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,340
I will say up front, if State of the Union is all the way on one end of the presidential

63
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:17,520
speechwriting spectrum, Happy Thanksgiving America is kind of on the other side.

64
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,180
But as far as I was concerned, this was the most important set of words Barack Obama would

65
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,860
ever say.

66
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,540
And so I threw myself into this.

67
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,860
I mean, I wrote and I rewrote and I made edits and then I made edits to the edits.

68
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,540
And finally the day of the taping came and I went to the diplomatic room, which is one

69
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,520
of the most beautiful rooms in the White House.

70
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,740
It has this wraparound mural of 19th century American life.

71
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,500
And the advice I always got was you have to act like you've been there before.

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,300
So I'm standing there trying to act like I've been there before.

73
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,980
And the woman behind the camera takes one look at me and goes, this is your first time

74
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,580
here, isn't it?

75
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,580
And I crack immediately.

76
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,740
I'm just like, yes, I have never been here before.

77
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,260
Please help me.

78
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,360
And she says, don't worry.

79
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,120
She explains her name is Hope Hall.

80
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,080
She films the president all the time.

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,400
She's going to take care of everything.

82
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
All I have to do is wait.

83
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,600
So I wait and I wait and I wait and I wait.

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,660
And just when I'm wondering, is this whole thing a nightmare?

85
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,400
Is it a practical joke?

86
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,100
Somebody gets an email on their Blackberry and they say, okay, he's moving.

87
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,820
And then there's kind of a crackling in the air.

88
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,520
And a minute later, President Obama enters the room and he's standing up.

89
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,120
So we all stand up and he sits down.

90
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,320
So we all sit down and he looks at the camera to start taping when Hope stops him.

91
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,940
And she says, actually, Mr. President, this is David.

92
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,800
This is the first video he's ever written for you.

93
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:52,000
And President Obama looks at me and he says, oh, how's it going, David?

94
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,800
I had exactly one thought in that moment.

95
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,680
I did not realize we were going to have to answer questions.

96
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,440
And I have literally no idea what I said after that.

97
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,400
I mean, I actually blacked out.

98
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,360
Like I went home for Thanksgiving and my family was like, so have you met him yet?

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
And I was like, yeah.

100
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
And they were like, what did he say?

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
And I was like, how's it going?

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
And they were like, what did you say?

103
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,320
I was like, I don't know, I blacked out.

104
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,360
And I get that disappointed look.

105
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,160
And I can't blame anybody because if I'm going to be the kind of person who makes the president

106
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,960
a little bit better at his job when I'm in the room, I am going to have to deal with

107
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,340
questions more complicated than how's it going.

108
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,560
And at the moment, there's no indication that I can do it.

109
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,320
But I make a promise to myself.

110
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:51,120
I say, if I ever get another shot at a life-changing moment, I am not going to let myself down.

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,000
And I didn't know if it would ever happen for me.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,440
But in fact, it happened just a couple weeks later.

113
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I was sitting in my office.

114
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,240
I got a phone call from the chief speechwriter at the time, a guy named John Favreau.

115
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,800
And he called me up and he said, Betty White is turning 90 years old.

116
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,360
And NBC is doing this special where different famous people wish her a happy birthday in

117
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,880
these 30-second skits.

118
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
And you're pretty funny and no one else wants to do it.

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,320
Want to give it a shot.

120
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,440
And I said, absolutely.

121
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,360
And again, I understand State of the Union is over here and happy birthday Betty White

122
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,320
is over there.

123
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,740
But this was my Gettysburg address.

124
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,280
And so we had one week to make it perfect.

125
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,160
We started off, John and I came up with a joke for the president.

126
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,380
We were going to have him fill out a birthday card.

127
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,040
And then while he was filling it out, you would hear his voice on a voiceover say, dear

128
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Betty, you're so young and full of life.

129
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,680
I can't believe you're turning 90.

130
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
In fact, I don't believe it.

131
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,840
Please send a copy of your long form birth certificate to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington,

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,240
D.C.

133
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,340
So we feel good about the joke, but we still need a birthday card.

134
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,360
So one day that week, I go to CVS near the White House.

135
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,680
It's a half block away.

136
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,960
I grab a birthday card that I think is going to be pretty good.

137
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,080
And then right when I'm about to leave, I realize we don't actually need one birthday

138
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
card.

139
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,360
We need two identical birthday cards because we have two different camera angles.

140
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,680
We don't want anyone to know that the president has already written his birthday greeting.

141
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,120
And I think, yes, this is how White House staffers are supposed to feel.

142
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,000
I mean, I've I've saved the day.

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,760
And so I walk back to that to that Hallmark rack and I get an identical card and I ring

144
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,200
it up and I go back to my office and I'm feeling really good.

145
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,920
And then the last thing we need, we need some way to end the video.

146
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,440
And so what I come up with is we're going to have the president put in headphones and

147
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,960
then he'll listen to the theme song from the Golden Girls, which is Betty White's most

148
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,040
popular show.

149
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,360
So I find the perfect pair of headphones that go over the ear, they look great on camera.

150
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,600
And I listen to the Golden Girls theme song on repeat just to get in the mood.

151
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,680
And then finally, on Friday, I get the call.

152
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Come on over.

153
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,400
Now, here's what they don't tell you about having a meeting in the Oval Office.

154
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,280
When you have a meeting in the Oval Office, you do not just walk into the Oval Office.

155
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,800
The first thing you do, you wait in this kind of windowless chamber.

156
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,560
It's a little like a doctor's office, except instead of last year's Marie Claire magazine,

157
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,680
they have priceless pieces of American art.

158
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,000
And instead of receptionist, they have a man with a gun who in a worst case scenario is

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,720
legally obligated to kill you.

160
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,040
It turns out this little room is the perfect place to second guess every life choice you

161
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,760
have ever made.

162
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,320
And so I'm sitting there with Hope Hall, the videographer, and I'm just thinking, do I

163
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
remember how to explain the joke?

164
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,840
Are both of the birthday cards in there?

165
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,200
I check my pants pocket.

166
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,760
Are the headphones still there?

167
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Are the headphones still there?

168
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,160
Are the headphones still there?

169
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown when finally one of the president's aides pokes

170
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,960
her head out and says, OK, he's ready for you.

171
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Go on in.

172
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:09,280
To my credit, the first time I entered the Oval Office, I do not black out.

173
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,420
I can remember this very clearly.

174
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,600
Right in front of me, I can see a painting of the Statue of Liberty that was done by

175
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,280
Norman Rockwell that someone has told me is valued at $12 million.

176
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,760
And behind me, out of the corner of my eye, I can see the Emancipation Proclamation.

177
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,160
Not a photocopy of the Emancipation Proclamation, the Emancipation Proclamation.

178
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,600
And I can feel the message that this document is sending through the room.

179
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,400
And that message is, I'm here because I freed the slaves.

180
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:49,920
What are you doing here?

181
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,760
And I look across the desk at the president, and I realize he may also be wondering what

182
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,320
I'm doing here.

183
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
But I feel great.

184
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,560
I mean, I've spent an entire week just practicing how to explain this one joke to the president.

185
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,860
So I step up, I look at him, and I open my mouth.

186
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,580
And what comes out is like I'm trying to ask for directions, but in Spanish.

187
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,000
Like the nouns and the verbs are there, but there's nothing in between them.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,120
I just say, Betty White, video, NBC, very funny, everybody laughs, está bien?

189
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:32,040
And the president gives me kind of a confused look.

190
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,400
And I hope the videographer jumps in and explains everything and rescues me.

191
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,520
But I'm a little concerned because I am here to show the president how professional I am.

192
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,160
And in my professional opinion, we are not off to a great start.

193
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,740
Still, I'm not that worried because I have that second birthday card in my pocket.

194
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,100
And so I'm going to get a chance to show President Obama how I save the day.

195
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,340
And as soon as hope is finished filming, even I am surprised by how confident I sound when

196
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,640
I walk up to the desk and I put my hand down and I say, Mr. President, I'm going to need

197
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,500
to take that birthday card and replace it with this identical birthday card because

198
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,140
we don't want anyone to know you've already written your birthday greeting.

199
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:17,140
And President Obama looks up at me and he says, we're filming this from all the way

200
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,880
across the room?

201
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,280
And I say, yes, that's right.

202
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:29,200
And he says, so no one's going to see the inside of the card.

203
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
And I say, yes, that's right.

204
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,600
And he says, so I can just pretend to write in the card?

205
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,360
We don't actually need another one?

206
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,880
And I say, yes, that's right.

207
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,960
And I put the card back in my pocket and it's strike two.

208
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,400
But I'm not giving up yet because I made that promise to myself.

209
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,340
And besides, I really do feel good about the ending with the headphones.

210
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,160
And so the moment hope is done filming her second camera angle, I walk back up to the

211
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,840
president and I reach into my pocket and I pull out what looks like a hairball made out

212
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,040
of wires.

213
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,520
I don't really know what happened.

214
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,440
I guess somewhere in that waiting room, I have just worried this thing into a hopeless

215
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,080
tangle and now I don't know what to do so I just hand the entire thing to the president

216
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:27,680
of the United States.

217
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:35,120
Now if you work in the White House, you will hear the phrase, there is no commodity on

218
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,640
earth more valuable than a president's time.

219
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:50,120
Which I always thought was a cliche until I watched Barack Obama untangle headphones

220
00:13:50,120 --> 00:14:04,200
for 30 seconds while looking directly at me.

221
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:12,080
And he untangles and untangles and when he finishes, he looks at hope and just goes,

222
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,720
shoddy advance work.

223
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,760
And he does it in this way that lets you know that A, he's only joking and B, he is not

224
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,020
even a tiny bit joking.

225
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,720
And I'll tell you, my heart just sinks.

226
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,200
I mean, this was my third chance to make a second first impression on the president.

227
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,800
And I let myself down and all I want to do is get out of there.

228
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,360
And President Obama says something like, well, would it be funnier if I bobbed my head in

229
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
time to the music?

230
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,480
And I say, yeah, that would be funnier.

231
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,520
But my heart isn't in it, I mean, I know I don't belong there.

232
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,760
And the president looks into the camera to tape this final scene and then suddenly he

233
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:02,640
stops and he says, well, wait a second, if I'm going to bob my head in time to the music,

234
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,000
I need to know how the music goes.

235
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Does anyone here know the Golden Girls theme song?

236
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,280
And President Obama looks at hope and hope doesn't say anything.

237
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,280
So I look at hope and hope doesn't say anything.

238
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,280
So President Obama looks at me.

239
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:33,760
And suddenly, I know exactly what I can do for my country.

240
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,480
And so I'm standing there in the Oval Office with the Emancipation Proclamation right behind

241
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,120
me.

242
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,460
And I look our commander in chief in the eye.

243
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:59,580
And I say, thank you for being a friend, travel down the road and back again, something, something

244
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,540
you're a pal and a confidant.

245
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,660
But he looks kind of amused.

246
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,660
So I keep going.

247
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,520
I'm like, and if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew.

248
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,620
And that's when he gives me a look that's like, okay, President's time.

249
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,140
But it works.

250
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,320
President Obama bobs his head in time to the music and Betty White gets her card and NBC

251
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,960
gets their special.

252
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,680
And I leave the Oval Office that day with my head held high, knowing that the President

253
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,680
of the United States was just a tiny bit better at his job because I was in the room.

254
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,400
And people still ask me after that, they still say, have you met him yet?

255
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,160
Have you met Obama yet?

256
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,880
And I can finally say, yeah, actually I have.

257
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:50,800
And then just to myself, I think, not to brag or anything, but technically, I'm thankful

258
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
he's a friend.

259
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,160
Thank you very much.

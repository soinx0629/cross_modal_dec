1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,420
So I get a phone call from my mom and she tells me that my father is about to

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:15,700
get on an emergency life flight from our home in Montana to go to Denver to get

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:24,660
an emergency liver transplant. My mom is kind of perennially optimistic and she's

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,620
telling me don't worry it's gonna be okay we're gonna pull through this it's

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:33,740
gonna be alright but I know something is really wrong so I get the next flight I

6
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,180
can to go from where I'm leaving here in New York hoping that I get there before

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:46,260
my father dies and I'm really glad I got that flight as fast as I did because I

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,820
was able to spend a couple hours with my father before he passed away and before

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:59,540
I know it I'm at this side of his hospital bed with my mom and we're

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:09,440
sobbing because he's passed. My dad was a he was a strong silent type he was he

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,580
was a grew up on a farm and he was the town one of one of two town eye doctors

12
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:21,340
so he could fix anything you know he could fix tractors or eyes he can you

13
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,660
know no matter what and he was always doing it like behind the scenes you know

14
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:34,020
he never wanted to take credit for it. It was apparent that my mom and I and my

15
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,220
two brothers were gonna have to be fixing things ourself this time around

16
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:45,060
and the first thing my mom did was was to call my two brothers one's a year

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,420
older one is a year younger and it was gonna be really comforting to see my

18
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,060
younger brother we were really close it was gonna he was really gonna support

19
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,340
me it was gonna be much more complicated seeing my older brother we'd always had

20
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:11,300
a really complicated relationship and there was something really big about me

21
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:18,300
that he did not know and that's that the last time he saw me years and years

22
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:26,300
before I was male he was not aware that I had transitioned from being male to

23
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:33,340
being female and you know I always wanted to tell him I was trying to find

24
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:40,540
the right time the right place trying to you know get up the nerve I was worried

25
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,700
about his reaction maybe that you know he was a bit conservative he had a

26
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,900
temper I didn't know how it's gonna happen and I just kept putting it off

27
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,740
and never found the right time and here we are at the time where I have to deal

28
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,940
with all this stuff. Mark wasn't the only one who didn't know my story my whole

29
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:09,460
hometown didn't know about me either and you know I was trying to find a way to

30
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,340
tell Mark I just kind of figured with my hometown I just I just would never go

31
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,540
back there again so my mom calls my brother and in one phone call tells him

32
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:32,900
that he lost his father and then he now has a sister and I have to say I mean

33
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,420
Mark was he was really great he he got off the plane we met him at the airport

34
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:46,140
he gave me a hug but it was awkward as you can imagine and you know I think we

35
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,460
did what a lot of families do at times like that you just kind of fall back on

36
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:58,780
tradition and we wanted to do something that my mom and dad had always done

37
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:06,260
every year because you see it was my father's birthday he had passed away 20

38
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:17,660
minutes before before his 65th birthday so we all went to Applebee's and we got

39
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:24,700
a slice of sizzling apple pie and put a candle in it and my brother Mark who

40
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:31,060
really worshiped my father got the honor of blowing out the candle and when he

41
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,980
was blowing out the can I'm still remember the expression on his face he

42
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,540
was you know trying to process my father's passing he was figuring out

43
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,500
why it had been so long that the two of us hadn't talked something that really

44
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:56,180
frustrated him and it was just all kind of coming together I took a business

45
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:02,100
card out of my purse it was for this job that Mark didn't even know I had I had

46
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,660
my new name on it and I wrote my cell phone number on it and I gave it to

47
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,740
Mark I said look you know we haven't talked for so long but here anytime any

48
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,460
place no barriers call me anywhere you know we can talk anytime you want and my

49
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:27,180
mom started crying because her you know her children were reuniting and also

50
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,980
because you know for years she had been running interference between the two of

51
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,700
us and using every excuse in the book to explain why I wasn't getting back to

52
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,900
him or why you know packages to me were being returned because they had the

53
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,980
wrong name on them and if you know her job running interference was over so

54
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,020
Mark was in shock we were all in shock I was in shock because I was thinking

55
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:02,700
about the fact that you know nobody in my hometown knew and I'm wondering if I

56
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:10,420
can go back for the for the funeral if I if I should go back if my mom and my

57
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:17,460
brothers really want me to really deep down and I'm thinking that you know I

58
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,020
never even thought I was gonna go back to my hometown and now I'm being I'm

59
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:31,820
being pulled back right into it as contradictory as it may seem as soon as

60
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,700
there was a reason to go back I had this really deep strong yearning to go back I

61
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,420
mean I I had gone to school in New York and San Francisco and traveled all over

62
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,100
the world and this place that I thought of as home that I think I've really

63
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,900
repressed knowing that I couldn't go back there right I didn't I don't need

64
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,700
to go back there but as soon as there was a reason for me to go back there a

65
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,100
very strong reason I really really wanted to go I wanted to see the house

66
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,700
the only house I had ever known growing up I wanted to go back to my hometown and

67
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,740
these people that you know comprises community that I thought of as home

68
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:21,460
right and my mom reassured me that she she wanted me to be there that she in

69
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,100
fact needed me there for support my brothers too and my mom had a plan to get

70
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,140
us there you know our family had been separated for a long time so she had the

71
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:40,080
idea for all of us to rent a car and drive the 20 hours from Denver back to

72
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,120
Montana so before you know it there we are in the car you know my brother hasn't

73
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,720
seen me for years especially not as female and here we are and we we had so

74
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,000
much to do we were planning we were planning his service my father's funeral

75
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,880
service we were writing his obituary my mom wanted to figure out and I did too

76
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,120
want to figure out how we could introduce the information about me while

77
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,000
still keeping the focus on my father so she had me driving out in the you know

78
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,320
across Wyoming 70 miles an hour she had me take dictation of her friends and she

79
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,320
wanted to invite them over for tea so she had this really strategic list it's

80
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,680
like you invite Judy and she's going to tell all the people in the arts

81
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,880
community that my mom was involved in and you're gonna tell June and June is

82
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,040
gonna tell all the people at dad's office and we'll find somebody else and

83
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:44,440
she's gonna tell everybody at the church and the next night there they

84
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,040
were 18 of my mom's best friends and the minister from the church where the

85
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,480
service was gonna be performed they're drinking tea my mom says you all know

86
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:06,000
very well by now that I've lost my husband and I know a lot of you have

87
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:16,920
wondered what happened to my middle son who seemed to disappear and she said I

88
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,920
want you to know tonight that yeah I have a daughter and her name is Kim and

89
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,440
this is my child and I love my child and I hope you do too and we can focus on

90
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,280
this tonight we can talk about this tonight you all are my ambassadors if

91
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,160
someone has questions at the funeral and I'm caught up in things I want I'm going

92
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,480
to point them to you and let you tell this story because you can talk about it

93
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:57,860
in a sensitive way and she you know took a couple a couple questions from the

94
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:05,260
people there and the whole tea party and did slightly different than the tea

95
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:13,300
party we hear about in the news the whole thing ended with everybody raising

96
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,260
their teacups and saying hip hip hooray for Kim hip hip hooray for Kim there

97
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,140
were a couple amens and some applause and and then everybody went home and I

98
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:30,100
swear there was a brown out from all the simultaneous phone calls that were being

99
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,980
made dispensing the information right so then the next thing there was a viewing

100
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:43,820
of my father's body at the funeral home and I had elected not to go because you

101
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,060
know I didn't want the focus to be on me I was going to keep it on everybody and

102
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,780
keep it on my father but my best friend Tim from high school was at the viewing

103
00:10:52,780 --> 00:11:01,740
and he calls me up he had only known the new me for a couple days I hadn't even

104
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:09,460
told him but he knew me really well and he knew I was chickening out and he

105
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,540
called me from the funeral parlor and he said hey I got a lot of people here

106
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:21,300
they really want to see you I should probably tell you that the people he's

107
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:30,820
talking about are the football team because I used to be on the football team and so

108
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:47,100
applause and so Tim says where are you I got a lot of people want to see you I'm

109
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,780
like yeah I don't want to go and you know I want to keep the focus on my dad

110
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,260
I don't want to be he's like yeah yeah whatever either you come down here or

111
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:02,740
we're gonna come up there what's it gonna be I said I come up here I guess so

112
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:09,660
before I know it the football team is at my front door and a couple of them have

113
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,500
cases of beer under their arm one case gets tossed in the snowbank to keep it

114
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,220
cold it's just like high school and all of a sudden they're in my living room

115
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:27,060
and it's this wake instantly and this show of support for me and for the

116
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,620
memory of my father right and they're in my living room this living room I never

117
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:40,700
even thought I would see again and people were either laughing or crying

118
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,340
mostly laughing and I remember looking around the room and there's there's

119
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:53,820
Kevin he was one of the co-captains of the football team with me and I look

120
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,580
over there and there's my brothers Mark and Todd and they were you know we were

121
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,220
all very close in age so we had friends in common and they're telling stories

122
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:15,460
about my dad and there's I look over on the couch and there's Frank probably

123
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,820
should have all you also told you that not only was I on the football team but

124
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:32,100
I was the quarterback and so I look over on the couch and there's Frank he's

125
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,700
an offensive lineman it's the job of an offensive lineman to protect the

126
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:45,620
quarterback and Frank is protecting me once again 20 years later under very

127
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:54,220
different circumstances and he's got his arm around my girlfriend they're laughing

128
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,900
and knocking back cans of cheap beer and that was the moment that I knew things

129
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:06,020
were gonna be okay somehow and there was one more person there that night and

130
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:12,260
that was my mom and she told me something that we ended up repeating

131
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:19,580
quite a bit that weekend through the services she came up and she said you

132
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:29,020
know dad was always fixing things and it looks like he fixed this too she said

133
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:37,820
you know even though your father has died you've been reborn thank you very

134
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,980
much

00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
Under the Influence is our topic tonight.

00:01.840 --> 00:03.920
And I thought of a lot of different things.

00:03.920 --> 00:10.480
And the one I kind of wanted to talk about was my secret influence.

00:10.480 --> 00:15.140
There are people in our lives that are incredibly important to us.

00:15.140 --> 00:19.660
And I would even mention to say some of the most important people, everybody aside

00:19.660 --> 00:23.780
from my mother in my life, doesn't know anything about this person who I think

00:23.780 --> 00:26.500
about every day, and his name was Michael Marquis.

00:26.540 --> 00:30.580
And so if this were a violin piece, it would be called Ode to Michael Marquis.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.540
I met him when I was seven years old.

00:34.480 --> 00:40.580
And I was growing up, my mother had left my father when I was about two or three.

00:41.060 --> 00:47.020
And this was the first man that my mother had brought home, like for me to meet.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.400
And he was a Vietnam vet.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.200
He was a professional athlete.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.860
He had played college football, college baseball.

00:56.860 --> 01:00.440
He was a ski instructor and a golf instructor.

01:00.920 --> 01:06.300
He had like a big beard, and he drank scotch, and he had a German shepherd, and he had a lab,

01:06.720 --> 01:08.920
and he had this unbelievable MG.

01:09.140 --> 01:13.940
And not like those little like wussy MG's that you see, like it was like a 1933 MG.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.000
It was like a motorcycle.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.000
I mean, this thing was so cool.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.660
And the doors like went super low, you know.

01:20.660 --> 01:22.280
I mean, it was just so cool.

01:22.540 --> 01:23.760
And he was so cool.

01:24.200 --> 01:31.620
And he was the first person to really tap into, he may have tapped into it,

01:31.620 --> 01:34.840
he may have created it, I'm not sure, but a mama's boy complex.

01:36.560 --> 01:42.220
Which was that I had, I hadn't been, my father lived in Texas,

01:42.220 --> 01:45.580
and I hadn't been to Texas since I was about three, but I was obsessed.

01:45.580 --> 01:47.180
I had a Dallas Cowboys belt buckle.

01:47.400 --> 01:52.320
I would wear like, you know, flower t-shirts, you know,

01:52.320 --> 01:54.520
like Grand Parsons or something like that.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.480
I mean, this is about 1977.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.480
I was very into that.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.840
I only listened to Willie Nelson's The Red-Headed Stranger.

02:00.260 --> 02:04.860
My room was covered with cowboys and broncos and Indians,

02:04.860 --> 02:08.120
and like anything Texas was up my alley.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.900
And he met me, and he's like, why, what's all the Texas stuff, you know?

02:11.900 --> 02:14.280
He's like, well, you know, my dad lives in Texas.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.540
Well, he ain't here, is he?

02:16.540 --> 02:18.280
I'm like, no.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.580
He's like, well, I think I'd get over the Texas thing if I were you.

02:21.580 --> 02:24.440
I'd be like, you know, that really hurt my feelings.

02:24.440 --> 02:29.400
And he proceeded to like latch into this thing, like, so what, are you mama's boy?

02:29.740 --> 02:30.620
Cowboys lost today.

02:30.920 --> 02:31.980
Did your dad call?

02:32.580 --> 02:33.360
No, right?

02:33.360 --> 02:36.160
I mean, he's a very tough guy, very tough guy.

02:37.160 --> 02:44.660
And through a little bit of what my mother felt was kind of abusive behavior,

02:45.660 --> 02:50.000
I grew to love him, right?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.100
I mean, I hated him, but I loved him.

02:52.100 --> 02:55.400
I thought about him all the time and what he would think about something.

02:55.400 --> 03:01.580
And like, for example, he decided that since I was so into football,

03:01.940 --> 03:04.340
but you don't know how to play football, you know?

03:04.620 --> 03:07.140
What, did your dad teach you to play football?

03:07.280 --> 03:08.560
No, I don't think he did, did he?

03:08.560 --> 03:10.360
All right, come on, let's play football.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.140
No, I'm not looking for the pity thing.

03:12.140 --> 03:13.120
It was really pretty funny.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.520
I mean, he was a funny guy.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.260
He was trying to help me in his own weird way.

03:17.260 --> 03:23.620
So he takes me outside, he takes me outside, and he says, all right,

03:23.620 --> 03:26.060
I'm going to teach you how to play football, all right?

03:26.160 --> 03:29.840
But football is a man's game, it's not a mama's boy's game, all right?

03:30.600 --> 03:34.220
You make a diamond with your hands, your thumb to your four fingers,

03:34.820 --> 03:37.320
and if you can touch it, you can catch it, all right?

03:37.320 --> 03:38.080
So I'm like, all right.

03:39.080 --> 03:45.740
Bam! You know, and I was, and he's like, you still with me?

03:45.740 --> 03:46.740
You still want to play football?

03:46.740 --> 03:49.420
Huh? I'm like, yeah, I want to play football.

03:49.420 --> 03:52.180
He's like, all right, if you can touch it, you can catch it, all right?

03:53.060 --> 03:55.140
Bam! You know, and it just went on.

03:55.200 --> 04:03.180
I mean, and it was freezing outside, and my nose is bleeding, and I'm crying,

04:03.180 --> 04:08.600
and I want to go inside, and he's like, you know, you've got to catch this football, right?

04:08.600 --> 04:10.640
And so finally, I catch it, like, three times.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.060
He's like, all right, see, you're not such a little mama's boy, after all,

04:13.380 --> 04:14.700
and I feel kind of good about myself.

04:14.900 --> 04:17.600
I mean, you know, I don't want to have me go figure, you know?

04:17.980 --> 04:24.880
So my mom really liked him, and we moved to Vermont, and he took us,

04:24.880 --> 04:29.780
and he moved us into this one bedroom, one, not, it was just a one room cabin in Vermont,

04:29.780 --> 04:37.220
whereas he had this gig as a ski instructor, and it was really picturesque,

04:37.220 --> 04:41.980
and he really had it in his heart, like, to teach me how to be a man, you know?

04:41.980 --> 04:47.700
And we would, he taught me how to chop wood, and he bought me a jeans jacket,

04:47.700 --> 04:52.820
and he would have my mom do, like, patches on the back, you know, and it was really very cool,

04:52.820 --> 04:54.040
and I started to feel very cool.

04:54.040 --> 05:03.040
He took me to see The Man Who Would Be King, and, you know, I cried at the end,

05:03.040 --> 05:06.640
which is, this is a digression, I'm going to regret doing this, but it's my favorite line,

05:06.640 --> 05:10.000
since I have an audience, I have to tell you, it's like, Sean Connery is standing

05:10.000 --> 05:14.840
on the burning bridge, and Michael Caine shouts, he's, the bridge is burning, he's going to die,

05:14.840 --> 05:20.360
and Michael Caine scouts out, you know, peachy, will you ever forgive me for being so bleeding,

05:20.360 --> 05:27.360
so stupid, and so bloody arrogant, and Sean Connery says, you know, that I can, and that I do, you know?

05:27.360 --> 05:31.360
And, like, Michael and I sat there, and I just cried, and he was just like,

05:31.360 --> 05:34.360
pull yourself together, man, you know?

05:34.360 --> 05:40.360
We got in the car, a guy's a little M.G., and it's, like, freezing, and I'm crying, and he's like, come on!

05:40.360 --> 05:48.360
It was a good movie, it was sad, but it was, you know, you gotta, you know, I loved it, too, I loved it, too.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.360
But from then on, in my mind, like, Michael and I were, you know,

05:52.360 --> 05:56.360
Michael Caine and Sean Connery on adventures and things, and we had them, you know?

05:56.360 --> 06:00.360
I mean, I had to walk, I mean, it's really kind of picturesque, I had to walk, like, two miles to school,

06:00.360 --> 06:06.360
and I was only in second grade, and it was very fun, he insisted that I do it, you know, by myself,

06:06.360 --> 06:11.360
and my mother had a lot of problems with him, like, the, the, like, when my mother would go,

06:11.360 --> 06:14.360
she had to go to town a couple times, and he would take me on dates with other women,

06:14.360 --> 06:18.360
and, like, if you tell your mother, I'm gonna kick your ass, and I thought it was great.

06:18.360 --> 06:23.360
I mean, again, like, you keep being judgmental, and I was like, I was like, this guy is so cool.

06:23.360 --> 06:28.360
And I remember I, like, rolled joints for him for this other girl.

06:28.360 --> 06:35.360
I don't know, I have this vague memory of it, but, and finally, like, my most pivotal memory of him,

06:35.360 --> 06:41.360
aside from the closing of my story, is, is we had, you know, this little one-room cabin,

06:41.360 --> 06:46.360
I mean, it was really, really idyllic, snow, and Vermont, and all this other stuff,

06:46.360 --> 06:50.360
and, and Michael, we're out on this little deck outside of it, and Michael's like,

06:50.360 --> 06:55.360
see that, look at that buck, look at that buck, look at that, get the shotgun, Ethan, get the shotgun,

06:55.360 --> 07:01.360
you know, and I'm like, I'm like, what for? He's like, we're gonna kill it, you know,

07:01.360 --> 07:07.360
and I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, Mom, Michael's gonna kill a buck, Michael's gonna kill a buck!

07:07.360 --> 07:14.360
And Michael goes, you, I was gonna let you shoot it.

07:14.360 --> 07:17.360
You blew it, you know, and I didn't know how I felt, because I didn't want to shoot it,

07:17.360 --> 07:22.360
but now I felt like I should have wanted to shoot it, and like, I don't know, I felt very strange.

07:22.360 --> 07:27.360
Doesn't exactly make sense, but you can understand the subconscious, very influenced.

07:27.360 --> 07:32.360
And so, finally one day, I come walking home from school, this little cabin,

07:32.360 --> 07:37.360
and all my mother's underwear and lingerie, kind of like things,

07:37.360 --> 07:44.360
are nailed to the outside of the house, right? This is a true story, all right?

07:44.360 --> 07:52.360
And I'm like, wow, that's weird, you know? And, and, and, and inside there's like,

07:52.360 --> 07:55.360
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

07:55.360 --> 08:00.360
And, you know, we basically get in a car and we're gone.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.360
And we move to Atlanta, Georgia.

08:03.360 --> 08:08.360
And, you know, I don't know any more about what happened there than you do.

08:08.360 --> 08:14.360
I mean, long charade, I can guess, you know, but I've never asked my mom,

08:14.360 --> 08:19.360
my mom has a lot of issues, but that's not, this is Michael's ode.

08:19.360 --> 08:23.360
And so anyway, we move to Atlanta, Georgia, and what happens is,

08:23.360 --> 08:30.360
my father gets remarried, and for some reason, to my now eight-year-old mind,

08:30.360 --> 08:33.360
this is very disturbing.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.360
I'm not invited to the wedding, and I'm very upset about this,

08:36.360 --> 08:43.360
and it's kind of throwing my whole Texas fantasy scheme apart.

08:43.360 --> 08:48.360
And I get, but I'm in this like weird school in Atlanta, Georgia,

08:48.360 --> 08:53.360
and I actually get accepted to this little gifted and talented program,

08:53.360 --> 08:54.360
like for an eight-year-old, right?

08:54.360 --> 08:58.360
And I go to, and I get kicked out on the second day

08:58.360 --> 09:02.360
because I told some kid that his painting sucked, right?

09:02.360 --> 09:04.360
Or the teacher, I didn't get kicked out right away.

09:04.360 --> 09:10.360
I had to write a one-page essay about why I would, you know,

09:10.360 --> 09:15.360
I was supposed to write about why saying somebody's painting sucked was a bad thing.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.360
And I wrote in my essay that I didn't know that it was something bad

09:19.360 --> 09:22.360
because my mother goes out with lots of guys,

09:22.360 --> 09:26.360
and the last one that she dated told me I sucked all the time,

09:26.360 --> 09:28.360
and I didn't think it was that big a deal.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.360
Now, that sounds like, the truth is, I knew exactly what I was doing.

09:32.360 --> 09:37.360
Like, it wasn't like I was trying to make my mom look bad in front of the teachers

09:37.360 --> 09:41.360
to like deflect, you know, me being in trouble.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.360
My mom was so angry at me.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.360
She got this call from the teacher, and she hangs up,

09:45.360 --> 09:48.360
you little shit, you know?

09:48.360 --> 09:52.360
Well, I don't date lots of guys, and Michael didn't say you sucked.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.360
Yes, he did. All right, he did.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.360
But, you know, like, blah, blah, blah.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.360
And anyway, the point is, and then I got in a fight,

09:58.360 --> 10:00.360
and I got kicked out of this gifted and talented thing,

10:00.360 --> 10:03.360
and it was like a big deal, and my father's getting remarried,

10:03.360 --> 10:05.360
and they send me to a child psychologist,

10:05.360 --> 10:11.360
and my mom comes up with this idea that she's going to invite Michael to come to my birthday,

10:11.360 --> 10:14.360
like that I could really use this, right?

10:14.360 --> 10:16.360
But I don't know about this, but so my birthday arrives,

10:16.360 --> 10:19.360
and we're living in Atlanta, Georgia now,

10:19.360 --> 10:23.360
and who comes down the street in a little MG with the golden retriever

10:23.360 --> 10:26.360
right in the side of the thing, and his hair and his beard,

10:26.360 --> 10:29.360
and he's got this, you know, thing and a bunch of presents in the back,

10:29.360 --> 10:34.360
comes pulling up, and it was really one of the greatest moments in my life.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.360
I mean, I was so happy to see him,

10:36.360 --> 10:40.360
and I had all these boys come over for my birthday party,

10:40.360 --> 10:43.360
and Michael took turns taking us around the block,

10:43.360 --> 10:46.360
and he would like peel out fishtail around the thing,

10:46.360 --> 10:47.360
and my mother would be screaming,

10:47.360 --> 10:49.360
Michael, get him in, and all the boys would be like,

10:49.360 --> 10:52.360
your dad is so cool.

10:52.360 --> 10:56.360
And I'd be like, I know, I know, he's so cool.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.360
And it was really one of those glorious days.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.360
Michael took us all to Chuck E. Cheese's,

11:00.360 --> 11:03.360
and we went to see George Burns in Oh God,

11:03.360 --> 11:08.360
and everybody was just so into Michael,

11:08.360 --> 11:12.360
and I, by association, was a very studly guy.

11:12.360 --> 11:18.360
And so then it's the night's over, and Michael's going to leave.

11:18.360 --> 11:21.360
You know, Michael says goodbye, and I say, all right, see you later,

11:21.360 --> 11:25.360
and he starts to go, and I go to my room, and I start sobbing, right?

11:25.360 --> 11:30.360
And so my mother comes in, and it's like, what are you crying about?

11:30.360 --> 11:33.360
It's like nothing, nothing, you know, I just,

11:33.360 --> 11:35.360
I wish Michael was going to stay longer, you know,

11:35.360 --> 11:37.360
and she's like, all right,

11:37.360 --> 11:43.360
and she goes outside, and okay, but yeah, go, go, go.

11:43.360 --> 11:49.360
And it's very good, very good timing, very good timing.

11:49.360 --> 11:53.360
Like Pat Riley would say, it's all good.

11:53.360 --> 11:56.360
So much for him.

11:56.360 --> 12:03.360
But so Michael comes into my room, and I'm devastated,

12:03.360 --> 12:05.360
because as much as I would like,

12:05.360 --> 12:07.360
and everything for him to talk to me and everything,

12:07.360 --> 12:10.360
I am so upset, you know,

12:10.360 --> 12:15.360
and I really don't want him to see me like this, you know?

12:15.360 --> 12:21.360
And he tells me that, you know, he's going to stay in touch with me,

12:21.360 --> 12:24.360
and that don't worry, you know, my mom's a pain in the ass,

12:24.360 --> 12:28.360
we all know that, but I'm going to stay in touch with you,

12:28.360 --> 12:31.360
you're a great kid, you know, and he might have even told me he loved me.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.360
I mean, he was really being really nice.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.360
And he drove from Vermont to Georgia for a day.

12:36.360 --> 12:44.360
And so, and then he leaves, and you know, like I watch him drive away,

12:44.360 --> 12:48.360
it's like night now, and I watch the MG and the golden retriever like take off,

12:48.360 --> 12:51.360
and my mom comes back in the house and I hear it,

12:51.360 --> 12:56.360
and I just scream out the room like, I am never going to speak to you again.

12:56.360 --> 13:00.360
You know, I felt so betrayed by her, because if Michael was going to leave,

13:00.360 --> 13:03.360
I wanted him to think I didn't care, you know?

13:03.360 --> 13:07.360
And he, and I never saw him again, you know?

13:07.360 --> 13:12.360
And I got a message, my mother got a message about two or three years ago,

13:12.360 --> 13:16.360
something that she Googled Michael Marquis.

13:16.360 --> 13:21.360
No, she didn't, that she had heard from him,

13:21.360 --> 13:25.360
and that like he saw some movie I did and thought that I was doing really great.

13:25.360 --> 13:30.360
It really meant a lot to me because, you know, nobody I know knows him,

13:30.360 --> 13:32.360
but I carry him with me every day.

13:32.360 --> 13:36.360
And he's been the secret influence of my life.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.360
Thank you.

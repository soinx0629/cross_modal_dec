00:00.000 --> 00:09.240
It was five days before my ten-year high school reunion when my husband told me he thought

00:09.240 --> 00:12.000
he might be gay.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.480
He wasn't sure he was gay because he had never been with a man yet, but he thought it was

00:16.480 --> 00:18.640
something he ought to figure out.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.800
Good idea.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.080
Now I think he told me this at that moment, not to get out of my high school reunion,

00:25.080 --> 00:29.480
which would be understandable, but in order to, because we had been looking for houses

00:29.480 --> 00:32.840
together and we'd finally found one in Pasadena that we both liked.

00:32.840 --> 00:37.080
And I think somehow the forever of a wedding vow sounded kind of vague and idealistic to

00:37.080 --> 00:40.480
him where his 30-year mortgage was surprisingly specific.

00:40.480 --> 00:45.520
It was a commitment, you know, the kind of commitment you shouldn't make while your sexuality

00:45.520 --> 00:48.520
is pending.

00:48.520 --> 00:55.840
Now, as he was explaining this to me, I was thinking downstairs, our neighbors, we lived

00:55.840 --> 00:59.480
in this duplex apartment we were renting, the Kaufmans were probably just sitting down

00:59.480 --> 01:03.600
to dinner as they'd done for 52 years and talking about their brisket, and they were

01:03.600 --> 01:08.120
this couple that used to come up and see our new furniture, like when we bought a new antique

01:08.120 --> 01:19.120
table because Sam liked antique shopping, pink flag, and so they were like parent figures

01:19.120 --> 01:20.120
to us.

01:20.120 --> 01:24.240
And, you know, there were signs, like when I first met Sam, he had this leather jacket

01:24.240 --> 01:29.120
with tiger print lining, and I remember thinking it seemed kind of, the lining, I don't know

01:29.760 --> 01:30.760
it stuck with me.

01:30.760 --> 01:36.080
And then, you know, but then he asked me out, and we slept together, and he asked me to

01:36.080 --> 01:43.600
marry him, and I put on the big white dress, which he helped me pick out in front, seriously,

01:43.600 --> 01:48.480
in front of, you know, 200 of my closest friends, and I figured he's not.

01:48.480 --> 01:53.000
And also, I actually, I guess there was one thing I ignored, which I probably should have

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
paid attention to.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.400
He told me before we were, while we were engaged, he told me he sometimes noticed men, but he

01:58.400 --> 02:01.920
said he couldn't imagine sleeping with a man, and, you know, he just noticed them.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.560
And I guess I knew this was not good because I didn't talk to any girlfriends about this,

02:05.560 --> 02:07.840
and I talk to girlfriends about everything.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.400
So if I didn't, it was probably bad.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.480
But I did, at one point, I did talk to one girlfriend, we were in line at Disneyland

02:12.480 --> 02:16.120
for Space Mountain, and I told her how Sam had said he sometimes noticed men, and do

02:16.120 --> 02:17.120
you think that's bad?

02:17.120 --> 02:21.040
And she said, you know, she told me this theory of the spectrum of sexuality, and everyone

02:21.040 --> 02:25.000
lies somewhere along it, and some people notice people, but they would never act on it.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.680
Four years later, she realized she was a lesbian.

02:29.680 --> 02:33.360
My one person I confess to.

02:33.360 --> 02:39.080
So as I was recalling all these signs, I realized Sam was still talking, and he was telling

02:39.080 --> 02:42.720
me he felt so much better getting this off his chest, and he'd been wanting to tell me

02:42.720 --> 02:48.760
for a long time, and he felt so relieved, he kind of wanted to have sex.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.520
And I said, with who?

02:51.040 --> 02:53.040
And he said, with you.

02:53.040 --> 02:58.560
And I think he meant it as a compliment, but I have to go to bed and wake up when the bookstores

02:58.560 --> 02:59.560
are open.

02:59.560 --> 03:07.800
So the next day, I went directly to the self-help section, where all problems could be solved,

03:07.800 --> 03:12.080
and there was no book for someone whose husband thought he might be gay.

03:12.080 --> 03:15.840
There was a book called Loving Someone Gay, but it turned out to be for teachers and family

03:15.840 --> 03:19.400
members, but nothing.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.760
And I was nervous because this is LA, and I didn't want to pioneer a problem.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.320
This is a very bad sign.

03:28.320 --> 03:33.680
And as I'm looking for a book, any book, I remember I saw one called How to Survive Alien

03:33.680 --> 03:37.920
Abduction, and it wasn't a humor book, it was a serious book with things like block

03:37.920 --> 03:41.680
their mind control and get help from on high.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.440
And so basically, according to the laws of supply and demand, you're more likely to be

03:45.440 --> 03:48.960
abducted by an alien than to have your husband realize he's gay.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.120
That's what that said to me.

03:51.120 --> 03:58.320
And so I left the self-help section despondent and decided that it was time to go to therapy.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.000
Four days now from my high school reunion.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
So I went for the first time.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I had never gone to therapy.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.240
I grew up in Oklahoma, which is where my reunion was going to be.

04:06.240 --> 04:10.760
And I went, there was this thing called the Gold Group, because I was in the Writers Guild.

04:10.760 --> 04:14.040
Basically when I became a comedy writer, I decided my husband no longer wanted to be

04:14.080 --> 04:15.080
a straight man.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.080
That was basically what happened there.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.680
And so I was in the Writers Guild.

04:18.680 --> 04:23.840
And they paid for this thing called the Gold Group, and it was a group of therapists in

04:23.840 --> 04:24.840
the valley.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.680
And it was only a $10 copay.

04:26.680 --> 04:32.000
And it's possible you shouldn't skimp on therapy, but I thought I was going to be in for a while.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.660
So I went to the Gold Group, and I remember when I got in there, you basically get what

04:37.660 --> 04:43.100
you copay for because I was in this office waiting for my therapist, and I could hear

04:43.180 --> 04:44.180
the session next to me.

04:44.180 --> 04:48.820
It was this paper-thin wall, and I could hear a man sobbing, and I was like, they're going

04:48.820 --> 04:50.280
to hear me sobbing.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.620
And then when my therapist came in, she turned on this little oscillating fan, which I think

04:53.620 --> 05:00.060
is the system the Gold Group had come up with to deal with the soundproofing problem.

05:00.060 --> 05:04.220
And my therapist, and I didn't have anything to compare against, but I just remember noting

05:04.220 --> 05:09.700
she was very badly dressed, like pink and red together and stripes, and I thought she

05:10.180 --> 05:11.180
can't put together an outfit.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.460
And she has to put together my whole life.

05:13.460 --> 05:16.580
This is not good.

05:16.580 --> 05:20.660
And she had all these questions I hadn't even thought of, like, should you be HIV tested

05:20.660 --> 05:22.780
and maybe he's lying and he's been cheating on you?

05:22.780 --> 05:26.780
And she had a lot of anger that we worked on.

05:26.780 --> 05:31.780
So she felt better.

05:31.780 --> 05:35.020
Okay, so I proceeded.

05:35.060 --> 05:41.420
My decision was to go to the reunion with Sam and pretend everything was fine, because

05:41.420 --> 05:45.780
it seemed better than, well, one problem was Sam wasn't ready to come out, because he hadn't

05:45.780 --> 05:46.780
started.

05:46.780 --> 05:52.380
See, when he told me he thought he might be gay, he said, maybe I'll only be 30% gay,

05:52.380 --> 05:55.320
I'll find out, and then I could still be with you.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.620
And I was overwhelmed at the moment, but I do remember thinking, so he'll sleep with

05:58.620 --> 06:01.340
10 men and enjoy three of them?

06:01.340 --> 06:04.700
I'm confused how we're going to do the math of this.

06:04.860 --> 06:08.460
So he hadn't started that experiment yet.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.080
So he wasn't ready to come out, because he didn't know yet.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.460
So we just went to my reunion like that.

06:13.460 --> 06:17.820
So we stayed with my parents, which is not a fun thing, even when your husband doesn't

06:17.820 --> 06:19.300
think he might be gay.

06:19.300 --> 06:25.300
And I remember at the reunion, I won most successful, and I just was like, yeah, my

06:25.300 --> 06:26.300
husband's gay.

06:26.300 --> 06:31.460
You know, it was Oklahoma, the runner-up was, like, the manager of the footlocker, so it

06:31.460 --> 06:33.180
wasn't a huge honor.

06:33.820 --> 06:38.620
But anyway, I remember when I went home, I was really nervous about my mom, because my

06:38.620 --> 06:42.500
mom, it was like being, you know that scene in My Fair Lady when the linguistic experts

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
asked her to dance?

06:43.500 --> 06:47.100
That's how it was being alone with my mom with a secret, because my mom, like right

06:47.100 --> 06:50.340
now she would say, your voice sounds a little tight, honey, like she's very eagle-eye about

06:50.340 --> 06:52.140
these emotional things.

06:52.140 --> 06:56.980
And I kept worrying and trying to avoid her, and I completely forgot about my dad.

06:56.980 --> 07:00.460
And at one point, he was sitting there watching ESPN, and he said, is everything okay?

07:00.940 --> 07:04.580
And I said, no, you know, if everything was okay, Sam would be in here watching ESPN with

07:04.580 --> 07:07.100
you instead of in the kitchen flipping through House Beautiful with mom.

07:09.940 --> 07:13.260
And I basically told my dad everything, which is not the system in my house.

07:13.260 --> 07:14.820
You tell my mom, and my mom tells my dad.

07:14.820 --> 07:16.460
But I told my dad.

07:17.500 --> 07:24.700
And then I remembered why I don't ever tell my dad, because he was like, it was like I

07:24.700 --> 07:28.740
was asked, he thought it was as if Sam was asking permission to have an affair and I

07:28.740 --> 07:29.740
should just say no.

07:29.820 --> 07:33.780
So he's, in fact, his words were, I'd like to sleep with Debbie Reynolds, but your mom's

07:33.780 --> 07:34.780
not going to let me.

07:38.980 --> 07:42.380
I was like, but what if you want to sleep with Burt Reynolds?

07:46.980 --> 07:49.420
And to his credit, he had no experience with this.

07:49.420 --> 07:53.660
In college, he had had one, you know, there was one guy in his fraternity that everyone

07:53.660 --> 07:58.100
knew had realized he was gay and left his wife and kids, Jerry Hovelman, and no one

07:58.100 --> 07:59.020
had ever heard from him again.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.740
And that was like his whole experience with the gay population.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.260
So he was no help.

08:03.260 --> 08:08.660
And somehow, though, Sam and I survived our my high school reunion, but Mr.

08:08.660 --> 08:11.140
Kaufman, who lived downstairs, did not survive the weekend.

08:11.340 --> 08:14.660
He had died in a sleep of a heart attack and there was a funeral.

08:15.220 --> 08:20.380
And and I remember it was kind of a highlight for me because I had been crying in such

08:20.380 --> 08:22.580
inappropriate places all week.

08:22.780 --> 08:27.140
And finally, I was at a funeral and I could just sob, even though I think it was odd to

08:27.140 --> 08:28.900
people because they were like, is she the tenant?

08:28.900 --> 08:36.180
Because I was kind of like grabbing Kleenex from the mother.

08:36.180 --> 08:42.980
You know, but I remember I was there with Sam and we were holding hands and we were

08:42.980 --> 08:47.500
thinking I was thinking at least at a funeral, there's a body and a grave and

08:48.300 --> 08:50.180
something tangible to mark the end.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.740
And with the relationship, it's never so clearly marked.

08:53.340 --> 08:56.620
And it was a relief to be there with Sam for closure.

08:56.700 --> 09:00.140
And then it being a Jewish funeral, there was a need for a minion where they needed 10

09:00.140 --> 09:05.060
men to go. And I remember thinking, don't go with the men to Sam.

09:05.060 --> 09:07.940
I do not want him to go with the men.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.540
But then finally, I said go.

09:10.540 --> 09:13.260
And I realized I meant it in the largest sense possible.

09:13.900 --> 09:21.140
And about a week later, my dad called me and he said, you know, it's really 99 percent

09:21.140 --> 09:22.940
genetic, this whole homosexuality thing.

09:23.260 --> 09:26.780
And I was completely thrown and thought maybe he'd been on the Internet and researching.

09:26.780 --> 09:32.100
And it turned out that my dad had called Jerry Hovelman and asked him to lunch.

09:32.580 --> 09:35.300
He had tracked down this man and took him to Denny's.

09:37.020 --> 09:41.380
And I'm sure there were lots of disclaimers because my dad does not take men to lunch.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.220
So he probably was afraid it would sound like a date or something.

09:43.460 --> 09:48.220
And I'm sure when he showed up in shorts and black dress socks and loafers, it was clear

09:48.220 --> 09:49.900
he was not of the gay persuasion.

09:50.900 --> 09:58.220
But he asked Jerry all the things he wanted to ask, I guess, and couldn't like, could

09:58.220 --> 09:59.220
you have avoided this?

09:59.220 --> 10:00.180
And did you ever regret it?

10:00.180 --> 10:01.700
And is your wife OK?

10:01.980 --> 10:05.820
And it was maybe the nicest thing a father ever did, taking Jerry Hovelman to lunch.

10:06.420 --> 10:09.740
And just about a week after that, Sam was finally moving out.

10:10.060 --> 10:13.420
And I remember we were in the top floor of our duplex and downstairs, Mrs.

10:13.420 --> 10:15.500
Kaufman was gardening like she always did.

10:15.780 --> 10:20.700
And Sam hadn't talked to her yet because she was like a parent figure and he still

10:20.700 --> 10:21.980
wasn't ready to come out.

10:21.980 --> 10:25.660
And he wasn't dealing with things as he hadn't dealt with many things.

10:26.420 --> 10:29.540
And so I said, you have to tell her because the moving van is going to be here any

10:29.540 --> 10:33.060
minute and she's going to wonder because and he wouldn't.

10:33.060 --> 10:34.580
So I went downstairs to talk to her.

10:34.580 --> 10:41.140
And I remember she was she'd always loved gardening, but it was really about she seemed

10:41.140 --> 10:44.740
more desperate than ever to kind of keep things alive, nurture the living things and

10:44.740 --> 10:45.940
not to let things slip away.

10:45.940 --> 10:48.820
And she couldn't imagine why I was letting my husband slip away.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.460
And I couldn't explain to her.

10:51.540 --> 10:56.700
And so we just sat together on this bench and shoulder to shoulder to women alone,

10:56.700 --> 11:00.580
but not really alone as the moving van lumbered over to the sidewalk.

11:01.580 --> 11:01.980
Thank you.

00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
There are some scientists who say that the universe

00:02.700 --> 00:06.600
that we inhabit is not the only universe there is.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.640
There are alternate universes.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.640
They say that these universes arise

00:10.640 --> 00:13.720
from the subatomic realm of quantum physics.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.240
Here's how they say it works.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.680
Every time a quantum event happens,

00:17.680 --> 00:21.560
it produces all of its possible results.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.480
This is like saying if you flip a coin,

00:23.480 --> 00:27.160
it comes up heads, but it also comes up tails.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.840
Since those two results are mutually exclusive,

00:29.840 --> 00:32.600
the flipping of the coin splits the universe

00:32.600 --> 00:36.120
into two alternate universes, the heads universe

00:36.120 --> 00:37.800
and the tails universe.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.760
And since quantum events are happening all the time,

00:40.760 --> 00:42.400
it means that alternate universes

00:42.400 --> 00:43.840
are bubbling up continually.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.280
They're always being created, splitting off from ours.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.800
And these alternate universes are real.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.880
They're not just figments of the imagination.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.840
They're complete, whole, real things.

00:53.840 --> 00:57.080
I know this is true because I experienced

00:57.080 --> 00:58.460
an alternate universe.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.400
I was driving in my Volkswagen van

01:03.400 --> 01:06.080
up to a Tai Chi camp in upstate New York

01:06.080 --> 01:07.320
a couple of summers ago.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.560
I bought the Volkswagen van when I'd quit my job

01:12.560 --> 01:14.100
a few years previously.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.000
I bought the van because I quit the job

01:16.000 --> 01:18.920
as a custom database application engineer.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.000
This was not a job that I really had intended to become.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.580
When I was a kid, that's not what I thought

01:24.580 --> 01:25.820
I was going to be.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.520
It's just sort of the job I happened into

01:28.520 --> 01:31.060
and I always thought of it as the work I was doing

01:31.060 --> 01:34.180
before I was going to find my real work.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.360
But when I got close to about 40,

01:36.360 --> 01:39.800
I suddenly thought, oh my God, this could be it.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.160
This could be what I end up doing.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.960
This could be on my tombstone.

01:42.960 --> 01:47.640
Tom Weiser, custom database application engineer,

01:47.640 --> 01:49.560
wrote well-optimized queries.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.580
Many customers satisfied.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.120
And I thought, no, that can't be it.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.320
That can't be all there is.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.160
And I quit the job without really knowing

01:59.160 --> 02:00.440
what I was going to do next.

02:00.440 --> 02:04.320
And I knew that what I should do was to take my skill set

02:04.320 --> 02:07.480
and to make a lateral move to a career path

02:07.480 --> 02:09.080
that was more appropriate.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.340
But I really didn't want to do that.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.520
I didn't want to be so logical.

02:12.520 --> 02:15.680
I actually wanted something more magic.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.360
I wanted to be like the guy in the fairy tale

02:18.360 --> 02:22.120
that trades the cow for the magic beans.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.880
And I know that that's a bad deal.

02:24.880 --> 02:29.000
I know that the cow's a better investment.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.800
The cow's going to pay off in the long term.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.520
But if the magic beans work out,

02:34.520 --> 02:36.280
you're in a whole new story.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.600
So I quit the job and I bought

02:40.600 --> 02:43.560
a Volkswagen pop-top camper van.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.240
And I drove around country and what I thought is, okay,

02:46.240 --> 02:48.140
I'm not going to make a lateral move.

02:48.140 --> 02:50.160
I am going to drive around the country

02:50.160 --> 02:52.840
and I'm going to open myself up to whatever may come.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.240
And then what I'm going to do is going to arise organically.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.080
I'm going to find my next path there

02:58.080 --> 02:59.520
by the side of the road in Arizona.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.920
I'm going to pick it up and bring it back to New York.

03:01.920 --> 03:06.360
So I drove around the country, 25,000 miles, eight months.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.640
And when I got back to New York, I had no clue.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.440
I really didn't know and it left me very vulnerable

03:14.440 --> 03:16.800
to the New York question.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.640
The first question anybody asked, which is,

03:18.640 --> 03:20.180
so, what do you do?

03:20.180 --> 03:23.180
I didn't know.

03:23.180 --> 03:26.740
I didn't have a good answer and it made me feel really embarrassed

03:26.740 --> 03:28.420
because everybody knows what they do.

03:28.420 --> 03:31.060
Everybody does and I thought I should too.

03:31.060 --> 03:34.100
So when I was driving the Volkswagen van up to Tai Chi Camp

03:34.100 --> 03:36.660
the other summer, I felt very relieved

03:36.660 --> 03:40.060
because in camp, I know what I do.

03:40.060 --> 03:41.260
I do the camp thing.

03:41.260 --> 03:42.260
I do what's at camp.

03:42.260 --> 03:43.500
And I don't know if you know this,

03:43.500 --> 03:45.900
but there are a lot of camps for adults that are out there.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.580
I found them when I was driving around the country.

03:48.620 --> 03:51.060
There are Tai Chi camps and yoga camps

03:51.060 --> 03:52.740
and bird watching camps.

03:52.740 --> 03:54.940
There's even a camp where you can dress up in armor

03:54.940 --> 03:56.020
and joust.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.340
All the things that give us joy

04:00.340 --> 04:02.940
and that we tend to demean with the name hobby,

04:02.940 --> 04:06.540
those are the things that are celebrated in camp.

04:06.540 --> 04:09.060
And when people go to camp, they are so lit up.

04:09.060 --> 04:11.020
They are finally getting to do that thing,

04:11.020 --> 04:11.860
the thing they love.

04:11.860 --> 04:14.180
It's like, yes, I finally get to joust.

04:14.180 --> 04:15.940
I don't have time for that anymore.

04:15.940 --> 04:16.780
Really.

04:19.220 --> 04:22.460
So I was going up to camp and feeling pretty good about it.

04:22.460 --> 04:25.460
And I decided on the way, I would stop into Ithaca.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.420
I'd heard that it was kind of a neat town.

04:27.420 --> 04:30.060
So I pulled off the highway into Ithaca

04:30.060 --> 04:33.460
and it's on the southern shore of Lake Cayuga.

04:33.460 --> 04:34.980
There's flatland and these hills

04:34.980 --> 04:38.180
and it has a very particular microclimate there

04:38.180 --> 04:39.980
which allows hippies to survive.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.140
All the stores have names like it takes a village

04:44.140 --> 04:45.540
or hemp unlimited.

04:46.540 --> 04:49.860
And the children are all completely multi-ethnic

04:49.860 --> 04:51.900
and only wear cloth, organic diapers.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.980
It was really something.

04:53.980 --> 04:56.180
I drove around like sort of like Disney hippie land,

04:56.180 --> 04:57.020
just watching it.

04:57.020 --> 04:59.420
And then I drove up the hill up toward Cornell

04:59.420 --> 05:01.820
which has these stately buildings on the hilltop.

05:01.820 --> 05:04.820
And as I drove onto the campus,

05:04.820 --> 05:06.780
I had this stabbing sensation

05:06.780 --> 05:08.860
and I suddenly was pierced with a vision

05:08.860 --> 05:12.580
of an alternate universe, my alternate life.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.260
I thought, oh my God, I was supposed to go to Cornell.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.860
If I had gone to Cornell,

05:18.860 --> 05:21.180
I would have studied animal behavior.

05:21.180 --> 05:24.500
And right now I'd be a professor of evolutionary biology.

05:26.380 --> 05:28.060
I'm a professor of evolutionary biology

05:28.060 --> 05:30.180
and I've got a wife.

05:30.180 --> 05:31.940
She's got dark hair.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.660
She's really smart.

05:33.660 --> 05:37.580
And I'm a professor with a wife and we've got two kids.

05:37.580 --> 05:38.820
They like to sing.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.900
It was this completely realized vision

05:42.900 --> 05:44.900
of this alternate life and it looked so good.

05:44.940 --> 05:47.740
Alternate Ithaca, Tom, he'd made these great choices.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.140
It was really working out.

05:50.700 --> 05:54.300
And I drove around in a kind of a wash of nostalgia

05:54.300 --> 05:56.500
for this life that I hadn't had.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.820
It's like, wow, there's the human ecology center.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.540
I did all my grad work there.

06:02.660 --> 06:04.940
And there was this funky cottage that I used to live in

06:04.940 --> 06:07.620
when I had six roommates and we had a chore wheel

06:07.620 --> 06:09.340
and ate brown rice.

06:10.980 --> 06:13.700
And there was these gorges that we used to do drum circles

06:13.980 --> 06:15.300
and songs to the goddess.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.260
And there was this woman that looked just like my wife

06:19.260 --> 06:21.460
would have looked when I would have met her.

06:22.780 --> 06:23.980
I was overwhelmed by it.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.140
I couldn't stand to stay there any longer.

06:26.140 --> 06:27.740
I drove off the campus.

06:27.740 --> 06:30.900
I fled Ithaca and flew to Tai Chi Camp.

06:31.940 --> 06:34.100
But alternate Ithaca, Tom, came with me.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.860
Now at camps, I tend to really have a good time.

06:38.860 --> 06:42.020
I laugh a lot, I joke a lot, especially in Tai Chi Camp

06:42.020 --> 06:45.020
but the residents are kind of serious and slow moving.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.740
I can't help but kind of tease them.

06:48.740 --> 06:51.540
And in this particular camp,

06:51.540 --> 06:54.060
the teacher said that we were going to be meditating

06:54.060 --> 06:56.260
every morning from seven to eight.

06:56.260 --> 06:59.940
And she was looking for a volunteer, someone, a musician

06:59.940 --> 07:03.380
that would wander the hallways, playing an instrument

07:03.380 --> 07:05.920
or singing to wake up the residents.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.980
I'm not a morning person.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.300
And so I thought, oh, so I have a choice here.

07:11.300 --> 07:14.500
Either it's gonna be 6.30, I'll be lying in my bed,

07:14.500 --> 07:18.980
really grumpy, while some asshole sings outside my door.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.820
Or I could be the singing asshole.

07:24.340 --> 07:25.180
For the rest of that week,

07:25.180 --> 07:27.180
I was the singing asshole of the camp.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.580
Every morning I would roam the hall singing lustily,

07:30.580 --> 07:32.980
waking up all my fellow Tai Chi players.

07:32.980 --> 07:37.340
And the people there saw me laughing and singing

07:37.340 --> 07:39.420
and they said, Tom, it's really great to have you here.

07:39.420 --> 07:40.260
You're so happy.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.300
You're such a happy guy.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.420
And I thought, yeah, you think I'm happy,

07:43.420 --> 07:45.980
but you haven't seen alternate Ithaca Tom.

07:45.980 --> 07:46.860
I've seen him.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.340
He's happy.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.260
And the fact that he was so much happier than me

07:50.260 --> 07:51.940
was making me miserable.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.540
And I kept looking at everybody else's life

07:55.540 --> 07:57.260
and comparing myself to them.

07:57.260 --> 07:59.140
And I remember having lunch with a woman

07:59.140 --> 08:01.660
who were in her 60s and she was a calligrapher.

08:01.660 --> 08:03.580
And she was about to have her first grandchild.

08:03.580 --> 08:04.540
She was really excited.

08:04.540 --> 08:09.300
And I thought, maybe calligraphy, that could be it.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.860
And then there was this other guy

08:10.860 --> 08:12.940
and he had studied Tai Chi when he was in his 20s

08:12.940 --> 08:14.900
and now he was a sales rep at Dell.

08:14.900 --> 08:18.180
And I thought, damn it, if I had studied Tai Chi in my 20s,

08:18.180 --> 08:21.620
maybe I could be a sales rep at Dell now.

08:21.620 --> 08:23.220
I've never wanted to be a sales rep,

08:23.220 --> 08:25.500
but I was just getting carried away.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.620
That feeling that I was in the wrong life,

08:27.620 --> 08:29.900
I was in the wrong place, I couldn't shake it.

08:29.900 --> 08:33.060
I really tried to absorb the lesson of Tai Chi,

08:33.060 --> 08:35.700
which is to be present, just relax,

08:35.700 --> 08:38.660
accept what's coming to you and be present here.

08:38.660 --> 08:40.300
But I thought, yeah, yeah, that would be easy.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.660
It's so much easier to accept where you are

08:42.660 --> 08:44.620
if only you're in the right place.

08:47.820 --> 08:50.220
Eventually camp was over and I left.

08:50.220 --> 08:51.460
I drove back to New York.

08:51.460 --> 08:54.140
And as I was driving over the George Washington Bridge,

08:54.140 --> 08:56.140
I could still hear alternate Ithaca Tom.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.980
He was hanging around me, haunting me like a ghost.

08:58.980 --> 09:02.500
And I thought, oh God, I need professional help.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.900
So I made an appointment with the family psychic.

09:05.500 --> 09:09.100
This is the guy that's done readings

09:09.100 --> 09:10.940
for all of my siblings and my cousins.

09:10.940 --> 09:13.500
And I went to see him and he's an astrologer.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.820
So he did out my chart.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.620
And this time he was very interested

09:17.620 --> 09:19.660
in this polarity that he saw.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.340
He said, you have Saturn in the mid heaven.

09:22.340 --> 09:24.340
And this marks you as a person

09:24.340 --> 09:26.220
who could be very organizational.

09:26.220 --> 09:29.140
The organizational man, the hierarchical one,

09:29.140 --> 09:31.740
the corporate guy, the dad, the provider,

09:31.740 --> 09:34.700
not particularly sexy, but a straight up guy.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.540
On the other hand, there's Pisces and the sun.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.460
And they're squared with each other.

09:39.460 --> 09:40.300
You can't resolve them.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.340
Piscean, the dreamer, the mystic,

09:42.340 --> 09:44.940
the guy that's the artist never quite pinned down,

09:44.940 --> 09:46.340
never quite in a relationship.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.300
And you have to balance these two.

09:48.300 --> 09:49.940
You have to choose one or the other.

09:49.940 --> 09:52.660
And normally I love to hear this kind of thing.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.620
This is the great thing about going to a psychic

09:54.620 --> 09:57.380
is that for an hour they just talk about me.

09:57.380 --> 09:59.660
It's so interesting.

09:59.660 --> 10:03.060
But this time I was so caught up with alternate Ithaca time,

10:03.060 --> 10:04.900
I couldn't really appreciate it all.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.060
So I just blurted out what had happened to me.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.820
And I asked him, what does this mean?

10:08.820 --> 10:12.260
And the psychic said, wow, this represents

10:12.260 --> 10:15.180
a fundamental choice that you've made in your life.

10:15.180 --> 10:17.780
You could have been the hierarchical guy,

10:17.780 --> 10:20.180
but you chose to be the Piscean.

10:20.180 --> 10:23.580
If you had decided to be an academic,

10:23.580 --> 10:25.620
you would have been very successful.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.460
There's no doubt that the youth

10:28.460 --> 10:30.700
There's no doubt that the university structure

10:30.700 --> 10:32.180
would have raised you up.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.020
You probably would be married, have kids.

10:34.020 --> 10:35.940
And I thought, oh shit, alternate Ithaca time

10:35.940 --> 10:37.740
made the right choices.

10:37.740 --> 10:41.020
But the psychic said, if you had become an academic,

10:41.020 --> 10:42.940
your wife would have had an affair with your brother

10:42.940 --> 10:44.020
or your best friend.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.860
Alternate Ithaca time is crushed.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.900
He's just found out that his wife is having an affair

10:50.900 --> 10:51.940
with his research partner.

10:51.940 --> 10:54.340
This is the guy he's been working with for 15 years.

10:54.340 --> 10:55.420
It's a long-term affair.

10:55.420 --> 10:56.780
They're moving in together.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.780
She's taking the kids.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.140
He's completely crushed.

11:00.140 --> 11:01.620
Poor alternate Ithaca time.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.980
He starts drinking.

11:02.980 --> 11:05.020
He can't keep his lecture notes together.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.500
He can't keep his research together.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.700
He's coming up for tenure and it's all falling apart.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.980
And in the midst of his turmoil,

11:10.980 --> 11:14.740
he's suddenly pierced by this vision of himself

11:14.740 --> 11:16.500
driving a Volkswagen van.

11:18.180 --> 11:20.220
He's off to camp.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.140
It's a Tai Chi camp.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.740
He's not married.

11:23.740 --> 11:24.900
He doesn't have kids.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.500
He doesn't even have a job.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.260
He's completely free.

11:29.260 --> 11:30.780
It looks so good.

11:30.780 --> 11:33.380
This image, it pierces him to his heart.

11:33.380 --> 11:35.380
Begins to hang around him and haunt him

11:35.380 --> 11:37.100
like a hungry ghost.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.140
Thank you.

11:39.140 --> 11:39.980
Thank you.

11:39.980 --> 11:40.820
Thank you.

11:40.820 --> 11:41.660
Thank you.

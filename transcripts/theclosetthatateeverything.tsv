0	3700	My mom was a really amazing person.
3700	6700	She was the type of person that could take any mundane life event
6700	10100	and turn it into a party in about 10 minutes flat.
10100	14100	She was really, really into holidays,
14100	17400	and she could take our normal suburban Pittsburgh house
17400	20800	and turn it into all these magical worlds.
20800	24200	And not just for holidays that, like, everybody decorates for.
24200	27900	We had a special set of flags that were just for Memorial Day,
28000	32000	that were different than the flags that we used on the 4th of July.
32000	34500	Christmas was a really big deal.
34500	40200	We had a tree in every room, and every tree had a theme.
40200	42300	She liked themes.
42300	45200	I never had a birthday party that didn't have one.
45200	48100	There was the Victorian Tea Party,
48100	51500	and the fitness birthday party.
51500	54600	I'm an only child, what can I say?
54600	59200	I think she just really wanted everything to be special.
59200	60700	But growing up like this,
60700	65600	that also meant that our house had a lot of stuff in it.
65600	69200	If we're being honest, she was a pack rat verging onto a hoarder.
69200	70600	She had all the tendencies.
70600	73200	If she saw something she liked, she bought three of them.
73200	76300	She had all of these materials for projects that she never even started,
76300	77800	let alone finished.
77800	82900	She saved everything, like normal stuff that parents save, like schoolwork,
82900	87000	but then like old bits of wrapping paper and ribbons.
87000	90600	She never threw away a piece of clothes.
90600	96300	She had two closets and two armoires just full of her clothing.
96300	97600	And that was kind of her MO.
97600	99200	Like if you walked into our house,
99200	102500	you would never know that she had all of this stuff,
102500	106900	because it was all tucked away into closets and drawers, nooks, crannies.
106900	110800	The attic was so full that we weren't even allowed to go in it,
110800	113900	and it was all Christmas decorations.
113900	117700	So I, as much as I loved this celebration,
117700	120500	like I could just never wrap my brain around the amount of stuff.
120500	121900	Like even as a child,
121900	125900	I just didn't understand the point of having things that we only used once a year,
125900	128500	or that she would just buy and forget about.
128500	132300	So now I'm someone who compulsively cleans.
132300	135700	When I open my own closet and I see something that I haven't, you know,
135700	137700	looked at or thought about for a couple months,
137700	139600	it like immediately goes to goodwill.
139600	143100	I'm not super sentimental with things.
143100	146400	You know, my husband might get me a card and write a little note in it,
146400	152000	and I'll put it out and then find a way to like quietly get rid of it.
152000	156600	So growing up in this house,
156600	160300	I just, you know, I never could understand all the stuff.
160300	164400	I was just more pragmatic than she ever was.
164400	168900	She was also really sick for my entire life.
168900	171900	We had a lot of holidays in hospitals or when she was bedridden,
171900	173400	but that never really slowed her down.
173400	177900	You know, she always like dragged herself out of bed and got the stuff up.
177900	181500	And when she passed away, when I was 25,
181500	185800	it was sudden, but it wasn't necessarily unexpected.
185800	191000	So while, you know, my dad and I weren't really prepared for it emotionally,
191000	194300	we had had a chance to sort of deal with that mentally.
194300	197100	So that first Christmas after she passed away,
197100	199100	we decided we're going to do the thing, you know.
199100	201400	We tracked down the decorations.
201400	202900	We found as many of them as we could.
202900	206000	We put them all up and we had a whole family over
206000	208700	and I cooked my first turkey all by myself.
208700	213100	And even though she wasn't there and it wasn't quite the same,
213100	215300	it felt okay.
215300	217400	You know, this is the new normal.
217400	219700	We can figure this out.
219700	223800	And about a year after that, I got the phone call from my dad.
223800	225500	I'm going to sell the house.
225500	227000	You know, it's too big.
227000	231900	And I took this a lot harder than your average adult does.
231900	235500	It was the only house that I had ever lived in my entire life
235500	238800	from when I was born until I went away to college.
238800	245800	And I just couldn't imagine a world in where I wasn't going back to that house.
245800	247800	But despite my hesitations, this is what's happening.
247800	250700	So I go home to help him clean out the house
250700	253500	and immediately it is just stuff overwhelm.
253500	256100	I mean, there's 20 years worth of stuff here
256100	259100	that nobody has ever really gone through.
259100	261900	And I live in Brooklyn in an apartment.
261900	264700	What am I going to do with a formal dining room table
264700	267900	and like eight chairs that are so heavy I can barely lift them,
267900	271600	let alone an entire attic full of Christmas decorations?
271600	275500	And it immediately just made me feel like a pretty terrible daughter
275500	279600	because I knew the expectation was that I was supposed to keep all of this stuff,
279600	283000	that somehow one day I was going to have my own house
283000	288200	and I was going to fill it up with the stuff and our lives were just really different.
288200	292200	That was never going to be my thing.
292200	294600	So I'm standing there having this moment in the house
294600	296600	looking at this dining room table and my dad says to me,
296600	300400	you got to go clean out the closet in the bedroom.
300400	302000	In my house for my entire life,
302000	307000	this specific closet was always called the closet that eats everything.
307000	313000	And it was called this because if you lost something in my house,
313000	315100	no matter where this item originated from,
315100	318600	it wound up in this closet like that room in Harry Potter
318600	320600	where all the missing stuff goes.
320600	324100	It's like a series of pneumatic tubes like would connect the garage and the kitchen
324100	327400	and no matter where this item originated, it wound up in this closet.
327400	329600	And it would like lose a shirt and I'd be like,
329600	331200	Mom, have you seen my shirt?
331200	333700	Oh, well, did you check the closet that eats everything?
333700	336200	No, Mom, why would it be in there?
336200	338600	And she'd like open the door and pull out the shirt.
338600	340200	Is this the one you're looking for?
340200	342500	Just happened more times that I could count.
342500	347000	But the real reason that I was anxious about going into this closet
347000	351700	was because it was also where we kept all of the family photos
351700	355900	and the scrapbooking materials.
355900	357600	So I made a plan.
357600	360600	I was not going to engage with any of the stuff.
360600	362600	I was just going to sort the stuff
362600	368300	because nostalgia is the enemy of all successful cleaning expeditions.
368300	372400	So family photos, keep one pile.
372400	376900	Old unsent greeting cards, throw away another pile.
376900	380900	And that lasted for about five minutes before I'm knee deep in the family photos
380900	382400	going through every single one of them.
382400	387400	And I'm looking at pictures of us, you know, around that ugly table,
387400	391000	Thanksgiving and a bunch of, you know,
391000	394400	six-year-old girls in puffy dresses having a tea party
394400	397600	and photos of Christmas trees that were so beautiful
397600	400900	that they could have been in magazines.
400900	406500	And all that stuff started to get really real again.
406500	409800	And that is when I noticed this box.
409800	413800	It's just a normal cardboard box that looked kind of new.
413800	415400	So my first thought was like, oh my God,
415400	418400	here's another thing that she bought that she didn't even know that she had.
418400	421500	But I picked it up and the contents inside were like shifting a little bit
421500	422800	and it was heavy.
422800	430400	So I opened it and I look down and it is a box of greeting cards.
430400	434700	Okay, so she got the guy at Hallmark to give her the overstock for some reason,
434700	439500	you know, but then I noticed them and none of them have any envelopes.
439500	440500	And I thought that was weird.
440500	446800	So I picked up the first card and it was a first birthday card.
446800	449300	It was my first birthday card.
449300	450700	It said 2 Morgan on it.
450700	454100	And when you opened it up, it had slots inside of it
454100	457000	where you're supposed to put pennies from the year that the baby is born
457000	461400	and all of the 1983 pennies were still in there.
461400	465000	So I keep digging through this box and there's more first birthday cards
465000	468200	and there's cards from Christmas and Halloween
468200	469900	because who gives greeting cards on Halloween?
469900	472700	And Thanksgiving and birthdays and Valentine's Day
472700	476400	and cards that I had received just because or because we had a fight
476400	480500	and it dawns on me and it's apparent that this entire box
480500	482900	is every single greeting card that was ever exchanged
482900	486300	between me, my mom and my dad from the time that I was born
486300	490000	up until the fairly recent past.
490000	495800	And I just did not understand this box and it made me really angry
495800	498900	and upset because there was obviously something
498900	501400	that I was supposed to know about this box, something that she knew.
501400	505400	She was saving these things for a reason, but I didn't know what it was
505400	507800	and now all of a sudden here's this box of memories
507800	509700	that I am confronted with.
509700	512000	This is what I was so worried about losing in the house,
512000	514100	but now they're my responsibility.
514100	518000	And before I knew it, my whole body just started sort of reacting without me
518000	523100	and I panicked and I started to throw everything away just ripping things
523100	527100	and throwing them and I am weeping and that's how my dad found me
527100	531200	and he was like in a pile of greeting cards surrounded by stuff.
531200	537800	So I tell him about the box and we start to sort of calmly go through it
537800	541700	and he picks up a card and he looks at it and he says,
541700	544700	I remember getting this birthday card.
544700	549200	I had it on my desk for a while and then I threw it away.
549200	553700	I specifically remember throwing this card away.
553700	556200	So now we have this moment where we're laughing together
556200	560300	at this image of my mom like digging through the trash to save greeting cards
560300	568000	and it just dawned on us that we're never going to know the answer to this mystery,
568000	571200	that she's gone.
571200	575400	And I'm looking through cards and I see cards that I signed my name to
575400	579100	but that I don't remember buying and cards that have my name on them,
579100	582900	but that I don't really remember getting and without her,
582900	588000	without her logic and her magic, they were just stuff.
588000	590800	They were just her stuff.
590800	594000	The box, the cards, they weren't my memories to save.
594000	597700	They were her memories.
597700	604000	And she had just saved so much stuff that none of it was really special anymore,
604000	609500	you know, to me that the most special thing about this box was that
609500	613000	she had cared enough to save it in the first place
613000	617400	and that I got to experience that one more time.
617400	622800	So we each took a few things and ultimately we decided we could let it go.
622800	623900	We could get rid of the rest of them.
623900	627400	We took them to the recycling bin.
627400	635200	And the next day I went back to New York and I never set foot in that house again.
635200	639100	But I had this new sense of calm about the whole thing.
639100	646400	And in the back seat with me on my drive was a box of Christmas ornaments
646400	649300	and a card full of 1983 pennies.

0	14000	In 2008, I was one of those young people who became obsessed with Barack Obama.
14000	19760	I was a senior in college at the time, and after I graduated, I drove out to Ohio and
19760	21600	I worked on his campaign.
21600	27580	And after the campaign, I drove to Washington because hope and change.
27580	31140	And two years later, the White House actually hired me.
31140	33740	They hired me to write speeches.
33740	38180	And people would hear about my new job and they would say, wow, you must be really good.
38180	42500	And I'd say, I don't know, I hope so.
42500	47500	And they thought I was pretending to be humble, but I was entirely sincere.
47500	52700	It's not that I didn't think I had any talent whatsoever, it's just that I knew there are
52860	63860	300 million people in America, and some of them are babies, but a lot of them are adults.
63860	72060	And it just seemed unlikely that I was the best we the people could do.
72060	77060	So every day, I walked through the gates of the White House absolutely sure somebody had
77060	78900	made a mistake.
78900	82860	And while this was going on, my friends and family were equally sure they now had direct
82860	87580	access to the President of the United States.
87580	92040	Like I'm sitting in my White House office and I get a text from my sister, Rebecca,
92040	98060	and it says, how come the Department of Homeland Security doesn't have a mailing address?
98060	102540	Now even in the best of circumstances, this is a disturbing question to get from a family
102540	105880	member.
105880	108920	And if you work in the White House, you want to know the answer to this kind of stuff,
108920	110560	and I have no idea.
110560	112240	And it's like this with everything.
112240	119720	I mean, suddenly everyone has a law that only I can get through Congress.
119720	124280	Everybody has something wrong with Obamacare that I need to know about.
124280	126320	Mostly everybody has the same question.
126320	128960	They all want to know, have you met him yet?
128960	130880	Have you met Obama yet?
130880	134320	And I say, no, I haven't met him yet, and I get this look.
134320	137640	And it's a look I soon learned means you may be 24 years old and working at the White
137640	143360	House, but you're still a disappointment to your family and friends.
143360	144800	And I have to say, I totally get it.
144800	148440	I mean, everybody thinks that the White House is either like the TV show The West Wing where
148440	151800	everyone's hanging out with the President, or it's like the TV show Scandal where everyone's
151800	155100	having sex with the President.
155100	161560	But if you're looking for a Hollywood analogy, the White House is like the Death Star.
161560	165840	What I mean by that is just that there's thousands of people, they run around the hallways,
165840	169440	they're all just trying to make sure their little bit of their job works well.
169440	172280	And just because Darth Vader is the public face of the organization, it doesn't mean
172280	176560	that every stormtrooper gets personal one-on-one time.
176560	180080	So I try to explain this whole Death Star thing, and it doesn't work.
180080	182760	I still get that disappointed look.
182760	185920	And frankly, nobody's more disappointed than I am.
185920	190620	I mean, nobody wants me to meet the President more than me.
190620	191860	And there's two reasons for this.
191860	194780	The first is kind of corny, but it's true.
194780	199460	I moved to Washington because I thought, I don't know what it is, but there must be something
199460	201420	I can do for my country.
201420	206000	I want to be the kind of person where the President of the United States is just a little
206000	209860	bit better at his job because I'm in the room.
209860	214900	And the second reason is I would really like Barack Obama and I to become best friends.
215900	220940	Now, I'm not saying that every White House staffer imagined that they would become buddies
220940	221940	with the President.
221940	224980	I'm just saying that none of us ruled it out.
224980	226600	Like you would hear these stories.
226600	230460	Somebody got a fist bump in the hallway or someone else got invited up to play cards
230460	232340	on Air Force One.
232340	234120	And the moral was always the same.
234120	238380	Any moment could be the moment that changes your life forever.
238380	243500	Now my first chance at a life-changing moment came in November 2011 when I was asked to
243500	246380	write the Thanksgiving video address.
246380	250340	I will say up front, if State of the Union is all the way on one end of the presidential
250340	257520	speechwriting spectrum, Happy Thanksgiving America is kind of on the other side.
257520	262180	But as far as I was concerned, this was the most important set of words Barack Obama would
262180	263860	ever say.
263860	265540	And so I threw myself into this.
265540	269860	I mean, I wrote and I rewrote and I made edits and then I made edits to the edits.
269860	273540	And finally the day of the taping came and I went to the diplomatic room, which is one
273540	275520	of the most beautiful rooms in the White House.
275520	279740	It has this wraparound mural of 19th century American life.
279740	283500	And the advice I always got was you have to act like you've been there before.
283500	287300	So I'm standing there trying to act like I've been there before.
287300	290980	And the woman behind the camera takes one look at me and goes, this is your first time
290980	292580	here, isn't it?
292580	293580	And I crack immediately.
293580	295740	I'm just like, yes, I have never been here before.
295740	297260	Please help me.
297260	298360	And she says, don't worry.
298360	300120	She explains her name is Hope Hall.
300120	302080	She films the president all the time.
302080	303400	She's going to take care of everything.
303400	305400	All I have to do is wait.
305400	309600	So I wait and I wait and I wait and I wait.
309600	312660	And just when I'm wondering, is this whole thing a nightmare?
312660	314400	Is it a practical joke?
314400	318100	Somebody gets an email on their Blackberry and they say, okay, he's moving.
318100	320820	And then there's kind of a crackling in the air.
320820	325520	And a minute later, President Obama enters the room and he's standing up.
325520	328120	So we all stand up and he sits down.
328120	333320	So we all sit down and he looks at the camera to start taping when Hope stops him.
333320	336940	And she says, actually, Mr. President, this is David.
336940	339800	This is the first video he's ever written for you.
339800	352000	And President Obama looks at me and he says, oh, how's it going, David?
352040	356800	I had exactly one thought in that moment.
356800	364680	I did not realize we were going to have to answer questions.
364680	368440	And I have literally no idea what I said after that.
368440	371400	I mean, I actually blacked out.
371400	374360	Like I went home for Thanksgiving and my family was like, so have you met him yet?
374360	375360	And I was like, yeah.
375360	376360	And they were like, what did he say?
376360	377360	And I was like, how's it going?
377360	378360	And they were like, what did you say?
378400	382320	I was like, I don't know, I blacked out.
382320	386360	And I get that disappointed look.
386360	391160	And I can't blame anybody because if I'm going to be the kind of person who makes the president
391160	394960	a little bit better at his job when I'm in the room, I am going to have to deal with
394960	398340	questions more complicated than how's it going.
398340	402560	And at the moment, there's no indication that I can do it.
402560	404320	But I make a promise to myself.
404320	411120	I say, if I ever get another shot at a life-changing moment, I am not going to let myself down.
411120	413000	And I didn't know if it would ever happen for me.
413000	415440	But in fact, it happened just a couple weeks later.
415440	416440	I was sitting in my office.
416440	420240	I got a phone call from the chief speechwriter at the time, a guy named John Favreau.
420240	424800	And he called me up and he said, Betty White is turning 90 years old.
424800	429360	And NBC is doing this special where different famous people wish her a happy birthday in
429360	430880	these 30-second skits.
430880	432880	And you're pretty funny and no one else wants to do it.
434960	437320	Want to give it a shot.
437320	438440	And I said, absolutely.
438440	442360	And again, I understand State of the Union is over here and happy birthday Betty White
442360	444320	is over there.
444320	448740	But this was my Gettysburg address.
448740	452280	And so we had one week to make it perfect.
452280	455160	We started off, John and I came up with a joke for the president.
455160	457380	We were going to have him fill out a birthday card.
457380	462040	And then while he was filling it out, you would hear his voice on a voiceover say, dear
462040	464040	Betty, you're so young and full of life.
464040	465680	I can't believe you're turning 90.
465680	467120	In fact, I don't believe it.
467120	472840	Please send a copy of your long form birth certificate to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington,
472840	476240	D.C.
476240	479340	So we feel good about the joke, but we still need a birthday card.
479340	482360	So one day that week, I go to CVS near the White House.
482360	483680	It's a half block away.
483680	486960	I grab a birthday card that I think is going to be pretty good.
486960	491080	And then right when I'm about to leave, I realize we don't actually need one birthday
491280	492280	card.
492280	495360	We need two identical birthday cards because we have two different camera angles.
495360	499680	We don't want anyone to know that the president has already written his birthday greeting.
499680	503120	And I think, yes, this is how White House staffers are supposed to feel.
503120	507000	I mean, I've I've saved the day.
507000	511760	And so I walk back to that to that Hallmark rack and I get an identical card and I ring
511760	515200	it up and I go back to my office and I'm feeling really good.
515200	517920	And then the last thing we need, we need some way to end the video.
517920	522440	And so what I come up with is we're going to have the president put in headphones and
522440	525960	then he'll listen to the theme song from the Golden Girls, which is Betty White's most
525960	530040	popular show.
530040	534360	So I find the perfect pair of headphones that go over the ear, they look great on camera.
534360	538600	And I listen to the Golden Girls theme song on repeat just to get in the mood.
538600	541680	And then finally, on Friday, I get the call.
541680	542680	Come on over.
542680	548400	Now, here's what they don't tell you about having a meeting in the Oval Office.
548400	553280	When you have a meeting in the Oval Office, you do not just walk into the Oval Office.
553280	556800	The first thing you do, you wait in this kind of windowless chamber.
556800	560560	It's a little like a doctor's office, except instead of last year's Marie Claire magazine,
560560	563680	they have priceless pieces of American art.
563680	567000	And instead of receptionist, they have a man with a gun who in a worst case scenario is
567000	571720	legally obligated to kill you.
571760	577040	It turns out this little room is the perfect place to second guess every life choice you
577040	580760	have ever made.
580760	584320	And so I'm sitting there with Hope Hall, the videographer, and I'm just thinking, do I
584320	586320	remember how to explain the joke?
586320	587840	Are both of the birthday cards in there?
587840	589200	I check my pants pocket.
589200	590760	Are the headphones still there?
590760	591760	Are the headphones still there?
591760	593160	Are the headphones still there?
593160	597200	I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown when finally one of the president's aides pokes
597200	599960	her head out and says, OK, he's ready for you.
599960	601960	Go on in.
601960	609280	To my credit, the first time I entered the Oval Office, I do not black out.
609280	611420	I can remember this very clearly.
611420	615600	Right in front of me, I can see a painting of the Statue of Liberty that was done by
615600	621280	Norman Rockwell that someone has told me is valued at $12 million.
621280	626760	And behind me, out of the corner of my eye, I can see the Emancipation Proclamation.
626760	632160	Not a photocopy of the Emancipation Proclamation, the Emancipation Proclamation.
632160	636600	And I can feel the message that this document is sending through the room.
636600	639400	And that message is, I'm here because I freed the slaves.
639400	649920	What are you doing here?
649920	655760	And I look across the desk at the president, and I realize he may also be wondering what
655760	658320	I'm doing here.
658320	659320	But I feel great.
659320	664560	I mean, I've spent an entire week just practicing how to explain this one joke to the president.
664560	668860	So I step up, I look at him, and I open my mouth.
668860	673580	And what comes out is like I'm trying to ask for directions, but in Spanish.
673580	677000	Like the nouns and the verbs are there, but there's nothing in between them.
677000	683120	I just say, Betty White, video, NBC, very funny, everybody laughs, está bien?
683120	692040	And the president gives me kind of a confused look.
692040	696400	And I hope the videographer jumps in and explains everything and rescues me.
696400	700520	But I'm a little concerned because I am here to show the president how professional I am.
700520	704160	And in my professional opinion, we are not off to a great start.
704160	709740	Still, I'm not that worried because I have that second birthday card in my pocket.
709740	715100	And so I'm going to get a chance to show President Obama how I save the day.
715100	719340	And as soon as hope is finished filming, even I am surprised by how confident I sound when
719340	723640	I walk up to the desk and I put my hand down and I say, Mr. President, I'm going to need
723640	727500	to take that birthday card and replace it with this identical birthday card because
727500	732140	we don't want anyone to know you've already written your birthday greeting.
732140	737140	And President Obama looks up at me and he says, we're filming this from all the way
737140	738880	across the room?
738880	741280	And I say, yes, that's right.
741280	749200	And he says, so no one's going to see the inside of the card.
749200	752320	And I say, yes, that's right.
752320	755600	And he says, so I can just pretend to write in the card?
755600	759360	We don't actually need another one?
759360	765880	And I say, yes, that's right.
765880	771960	And I put the card back in my pocket and it's strike two.
771960	775400	But I'm not giving up yet because I made that promise to myself.
775400	779340	And besides, I really do feel good about the ending with the headphones.
779340	784160	And so the moment hope is done filming her second camera angle, I walk back up to the
784160	788840	president and I reach into my pocket and I pull out what looks like a hairball made out
788840	791040	of wires.
791040	792520	I don't really know what happened.
792560	796440	I guess somewhere in that waiting room, I have just worried this thing into a hopeless
796440	801080	tangle and now I don't know what to do so I just hand the entire thing to the president
801080	807680	of the United States.
807680	815120	Now if you work in the White House, you will hear the phrase, there is no commodity on
815120	819640	earth more valuable than a president's time.
819680	830120	Which I always thought was a cliche until I watched Barack Obama untangle headphones
830120	844200	for 30 seconds while looking directly at me.
844200	852080	And he untangles and untangles and when he finishes, he looks at hope and just goes,
852080	854720	shoddy advance work.
854720	859760	And he does it in this way that lets you know that A, he's only joking and B, he is not
859760	865020	even a tiny bit joking.
865020	867720	And I'll tell you, my heart just sinks.
867720	873200	I mean, this was my third chance to make a second first impression on the president.
873200	876800	And I let myself down and all I want to do is get out of there.
876800	880360	And President Obama says something like, well, would it be funnier if I bobbed my head in
880360	881360	time to the music?
881360	883480	And I say, yeah, that would be funnier.
883480	888520	But my heart isn't in it, I mean, I know I don't belong there.
888520	893760	And the president looks into the camera to tape this final scene and then suddenly he
893760	902640	stops and he says, well, wait a second, if I'm going to bob my head in time to the music,
902640	906000	I need to know how the music goes.
906000	912200	Does anyone here know the Golden Girls theme song?
912200	916280	And President Obama looks at hope and hope doesn't say anything.
916280	920280	So I look at hope and hope doesn't say anything.
920280	923280	So President Obama looks at me.
923280	933760	And suddenly, I know exactly what I can do for my country.
933760	939480	And so I'm standing there in the Oval Office with the Emancipation Proclamation right behind
939480	942120	me.
942120	946460	And I look our commander in chief in the eye.
946460	959580	And I say, thank you for being a friend, travel down the road and back again, something, something
959580	964540	you're a pal and a confidant.
964540	965660	But he looks kind of amused.
965660	966660	So I keep going.
966660	971520	I'm like, and if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew.
971520	976620	And that's when he gives me a look that's like, okay, President's time.
976620	978140	But it works.
978140	982320	President Obama bobs his head in time to the music and Betty White gets her card and NBC
982320	983960	gets their special.
983960	987680	And I leave the Oval Office that day with my head held high, knowing that the President
987680	993680	of the United States was just a tiny bit better at his job because I was in the room.
993680	997400	And people still ask me after that, they still say, have you met him yet?
997400	999160	Have you met Obama yet?
999160	1002880	And I can finally say, yeah, actually I have.
1002880	1010800	And then just to myself, I think, not to brag or anything, but technically, I'm thankful
1010800	1011800	he's a friend.
1011800	1013160	Thank you very much.

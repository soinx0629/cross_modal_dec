WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
I grew up in Providence, Rhode Island, and for my entire childhood, we were never more

00:05.760 --> 00:12.800
than 20 miles away from the core of our universe, the Kennedys.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.800
We were Irish, they were Irish.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.840
We were Catholic, they were Catholic.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.680
They were family.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.360
We were like the relatives that they never got to see.

00:22.360 --> 00:27.360
But we knew, you know, they're busy, and we knew that they loved us.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.980
So anything that was happening to them was also happening to us.

00:30.980 --> 00:36.760
So their tragedy, plus our own tragedy, was a lot.

00:36.760 --> 00:41.360
So this one Thanksgiving after dinner and a family fight at Grandma's house, we were

00:41.360 --> 00:42.800
in the car and we're driving home.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.600
And the radio was playing this 10th anniversary of the JFK assassination.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.820
And I'm sitting in the back seat, and I start to cry.

00:50.820 --> 00:54.800
And my sister Erin says, hey, Dad, Michaela's crying.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.220
And my father pulls that car right over to the shoulder of I-95.

00:58.220 --> 01:01.240
He stops it, he turns around, and he looks at us.

01:01.240 --> 01:12.000
And with tears in his own eyes, he says, don't you ever be ashamed to cry for that man.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.320
So my parents grew up near Newport, and they got married in the same exact church as Jack

01:17.320 --> 01:19.380
and Jackie, St. Mary's.

01:19.420 --> 01:26.380
And my father gave exact replica jewelry to my mother that was replications of the jewelry

01:26.380 --> 01:28.700
that Jack gave to Jackie.

01:28.700 --> 01:32.920
And every Saturday night after mass, my family would be in the living room and we'd be happily

01:32.920 --> 01:38.440
ever aftering to the original soundtrack of Camelot.

01:38.440 --> 01:43.700
And every year during the 70s, my four aunts would take me and my two cousins on their

01:43.700 --> 01:51.620
dream vacation, a rented beach house in Hyannis on the very cove sharing beachfront with the

01:51.620 --> 01:54.280
Kennedy compound.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.700
Every day for an entire week, my Aunt Pat would roll up her sister's hair.

01:58.700 --> 02:03.500
My aunts would apply sunscreen to the back of their necks, the backs of the hands, and

02:03.500 --> 02:05.100
the tops of their feet.

02:05.100 --> 02:08.920
And then they would drag their beach chairs down to the beach, and they would set them

02:08.920 --> 02:18.200
up perfectly, not facing the water, not into the sun for tanning, but perfectly for spying

02:18.200 --> 02:20.440
on the Kennedys.

02:20.440 --> 02:25.000
They would sit there all day in the broiling sun with high-powered binoculars and keep

02:25.000 --> 02:27.480
a constant surveillance.

02:27.480 --> 02:31.000
And every year they'd have the same exact conversations.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.320
Usually around mid-morning, the first sighting would be made, usually by my Aunt Pat.

02:35.320 --> 02:48.280
She'd be, up, they got Rose out, walking, Ethel looks drawn.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.020
And then about an hour later, my Aunt Gert would say, how old is Rose now?

02:52.020 --> 02:53.880
And Aunt Momo would make the calculations.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.200
Well, let's see.

02:55.200 --> 03:01.640
Jack died in 63 when she was 74, and Rose's birthday was two weeks last Thursday, and

03:01.800 --> 03:07.040
Joe died in 69, making her a widow at 81, so 85.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.880
And then they'd break for lunch.

03:10.880 --> 03:16.480
So after lobster and drawn butter and hosing us down, they'd all hustle back to their posts,

03:16.480 --> 03:17.480
and they'd watch.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.520
And every now and then, there'd be something they didn't know.

03:19.520 --> 03:20.520
Hey, who's that?

03:20.520 --> 03:21.520
Who's that?

03:21.520 --> 03:22.520
Who's that?

03:22.520 --> 03:25.600
So they'd draw out the family tree in the sand, they'd analyze it, they'd come up with

03:25.600 --> 03:27.800
a profile, and they'd crack the code.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.840
It's one of Bobby's.

03:30.840 --> 03:36.840
Now any mention of Bobby would always bring up the inevitable, oh, I just pray to God

03:36.840 --> 03:42.560
they don't tell poor senile Rose about Bobby, it'll break her.

03:42.560 --> 03:47.720
So then the long afternoon stretch would end with the inevitable annual observation, you

03:47.720 --> 03:50.420
don't see Jackie much here.

03:50.420 --> 03:55.880
And then all of my aunts would drop their binoculars and look at each other meaningfully.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.320
Now all of this meant that no one was paying any attention to me and my cousins in the

03:59.320 --> 04:01.440
water.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.400
And the summer when we were nine years old, we found something.

04:04.400 --> 04:10.800
Now had an aunt, perhaps in an effort to ease a cramp in her prying neck, just sort of glanced

04:10.800 --> 04:12.060
towards the water.

04:12.060 --> 04:18.740
She might have seen us climbing into this tiny plastic half inflated boat.

04:18.740 --> 04:23.720
She might have cried out an alarm at the lack of oars and life vests.

04:23.720 --> 04:28.640
She might have had a conniption fit to see us shove off and drift into the violent rip

04:28.640 --> 04:33.520
tide that would sweep us within five minutes out to the open sea and the Nantucket bound

04:33.520 --> 04:37.400
ferry.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.280
But an aunt didn't, and we did.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.440
It all happened so fast that we were swept out, and it wasn't until we realized that

04:45.440 --> 04:50.060
we could make out the specific features of the ferry passengers that we were really

04:50.060 --> 04:51.920
far from shore.

04:51.920 --> 04:57.120
We were so far from shore that my aunts were now reduced to four hopping dots.

04:57.120 --> 05:01.080
Uh oh, it was like Gilligan's Island for real.

05:01.080 --> 05:05.680
So an Atlantic swell crashes over our heads, and as soon as the water clears out of our

05:05.680 --> 05:09.720
eyes, a powerboat pulls up out of nowhere.

05:09.720 --> 05:16.040
And in this powerboat are David and Michael Kennedy.

05:16.040 --> 05:21.640
So David and Michael pull us up into the boat, and we are like, oh my God, we are saved by

05:21.640 --> 05:26.680
a powerboat.

05:26.680 --> 05:31.560
So the powerboat sends us back to shore, and we're psyched because we're saved until we

05:31.560 --> 05:38.160
start to watch the four hopping dots morph back into our four crazed, livid aunts.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.560
We are so going to get it.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.640
Now my family under any circumstances has this really weird thing, well they each have

05:43.640 --> 05:47.840
like their own weird thing, about like yelling and getting into huge trouble.

05:47.840 --> 05:53.640
Like my aunt Gur, like she gets so freaked out that all she can do is yell out our addresses.

05:53.640 --> 05:58.800
Like Eileen and Kevin, 275 Hooper Street.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.560
Michaela, 180 Asylum Road.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.120
I swear to God, I grew up on Asylum Road.

06:04.120 --> 06:07.640
It's a very telling piece of my childhood.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.880
And then my aunt Pat would do these things where she would say these things that were

06:11.880 --> 06:16.400
like actually kind of nice things, but she'd say them like they were death threats.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.560
She'd be like, yeah, I'll save you from drowning.

06:18.560 --> 06:23.160
You get on that beach towel and you lie in that sun, now.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.520
Or she'd say, I'm going to buy you a birthday present.

06:25.520 --> 06:28.360
You eat that cake, now.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.880
So we knew that this is what was coming.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.360
The Kennedy boys didn't.

06:31.360 --> 06:35.880
So they're vivaciously tanned and they pull up to the shoreline and we brace ourselves.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.560
Now what happens is our aunts are out of their minds.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.560
They're ready to flay us.

06:40.560 --> 06:45.960
But when they see us in the same boat as the Kennedys, it's like they don't have the

06:45.960 --> 06:50.040
emotional capacity to handle it.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.160
They kind of snap.

06:52.160 --> 06:55.800
They're kind of like freaking out to yell at us, but they start fake smiling and trying

06:55.800 --> 06:57.840
to act all normal.

06:57.840 --> 07:02.600
And my aunt Momo, she takes on this Kennedy-esque way of speaking, which is sort of halfway

07:02.600 --> 07:06.280
between Katharine Hepburn and the Queen of England.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.640
And we're looking at them like, what are you guys doing?

07:08.640 --> 07:12.880
And they're smiling to smile, but when they smile at us, it's like, you just wait.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.880
But they're like, oh, David, oh, Michael, thank you, thank you, thank you.

07:15.880 --> 07:19.480
And they're not mad at us for almost drowning.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.960
They're mad at us because the Kennedys had to save us.

07:22.960 --> 07:27.000
Like don't those people have enough trouble?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.400
Now you?

07:29.400 --> 07:33.960
Like as if our almost drowning was yet another Kennedy tragedy.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.320
So these poor boys finally pull and pry themselves away from my aunts.

07:37.320 --> 07:41.400
They get back on the boat and they're leaving and my aunt Momo's going, please give our

07:41.400 --> 07:45.000
best to your grandmother.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.280
And now it's time for our for real punishment, which was that we for the rest of vacation

07:50.280 --> 07:55.400
had to stay on the beach because we did not have any respect for the water.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.520
So it's a hundred degrees out.

07:57.520 --> 08:03.240
And after about a half hour of whining and fighting and like emptying out all the copper

08:03.240 --> 08:08.560
tone and kicking sand, we break my aunt Pat's last nerve and she says, all right, you can

08:08.560 --> 08:11.400
go in the water, but only up to your knees.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.880
So we're happy for a minute until we get in the water and realize how boring up to

08:14.880 --> 08:16.320
your knees is.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.480
And then we get the great plan of having chicken fights.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.920
So we start to have chicken fights, but it's kind of weird because there's only three of

08:22.920 --> 08:23.920
us.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.500
So, but we're doing the best we can to have a chicken fight like that and like knock each

08:27.500 --> 08:30.240
other off into the water so we get fully immersed.

08:30.240 --> 08:36.580
And then my uncle Al, who never ever played with us ever comes into the water to play

08:36.580 --> 08:40.800
chicken fights with us and he puts his daughter, my cousin Eileen up on his shoulders.

08:40.800 --> 08:44.240
And then I get up on my cousin Kevin's shoulders and we're having chicken fights and it's like

08:44.240 --> 08:46.160
actual family fun for a moment.

08:46.160 --> 08:49.100
And we're like, you know, hitting each other, falling in the water.

08:49.100 --> 08:56.560
And then I take my foot and I accidentally kick the side of my uncle Al's head really,

08:56.560 --> 09:09.840
really hard and his eyeball pops out of his head, falls into the water and sinks.

09:09.880 --> 09:14.960
It pops out of his head and it sinks.

09:14.960 --> 09:20.160
Eileen, Kevin and I are in instant complete shock.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.680
Right this minute there is still a part of me that is on that beach screaming.

09:24.680 --> 09:31.120
It's like, oh my God, we had no idea that he had a fake eye.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.840
We didn't even know that you could have a fake eye.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.040
Why would you have a fake eye?

09:35.040 --> 09:37.920
They didn't tell us that you, that uncle Al had a fake eye because they didn't want his

09:38.000 --> 09:40.280
blabbing it to the whole neighborhood.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.280
So they didn't tell us.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
So we didn't know.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.680
And like later on, you know, there was Columbo and Sandy Duncan, but this was way before that.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.920
We had no idea.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.560
So we're all standing there and it's like so horrible.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.080
Like I can't even like, I'm like, oh my God.

09:54.080 --> 09:58.060
And, and my cousins Eileen and Kevin are staring at me with complete hate.

09:58.060 --> 10:01.440
Like you broke our dad.

10:01.440 --> 10:07.280
And my uncle Al is standing there and he's got the lid open so you can like see inside

10:07.280 --> 10:12.040
the socket where now it's just like skin and the eyeball gone.

10:12.040 --> 10:17.640
And like, you cannot just say I'm sorry to someone that you just, so I don't know what

10:17.640 --> 10:18.640
to do.

10:18.640 --> 10:24.620
And my aunt Pat is hysterically screaming because that eyeball cost top dollar.

10:24.620 --> 10:28.720
It was a special magnetized eye so it could keep up with the other one.

10:28.720 --> 10:33.480
And now I had just been to pray that vacation was over and that they got that deposit back

10:33.480 --> 10:36.640
because now they were going to have to buy a brand new top dollar eye that was not in

10:36.640 --> 10:38.200
the budget.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.400
So I just didn't know what to do.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.360
I was like, my life is over.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.220
I am no longer Michaela.

10:43.220 --> 10:47.400
I am now Murph's girl who kicked Al's eye out in the cape.

10:47.400 --> 10:51.060
And it's awful and everybody's just crying and pointing at me and now my other aunts

10:51.060 --> 10:54.720
are getting in on it like and who's the blame part of the conversations happening.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.200
So I just kind of back off into the water.

10:57.200 --> 11:01.760
I'm kind of like going back and like regressing back to like where life as I once knew it

11:01.760 --> 11:02.760
had ended.

11:02.760 --> 11:06.600
And I just stand there and like, I kind of wish I had drowned and I kind of wish

11:06.600 --> 11:08.680
the Kennedys hadn't saved me.

11:08.680 --> 11:13.120
And I bent off into the waves and I just, I just started like sifting through sand and

11:13.120 --> 11:17.040
shells and pebbles and it's totally ridiculous but like I will never stop looking for this

11:17.040 --> 11:18.040
eye.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.040
I'm going to look forever.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.960
And I keep looking and looking and I'm sifting through and then all of a sudden there is

11:21.960 --> 11:25.720
an eyeball in my palm staring right at me.

11:25.720 --> 11:31.520
And so I scream and I drop it back and it sinks back into the water.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.160
But now we know it's possible.

11:33.160 --> 11:37.320
So everybody gets back into the water and now we're all sifting through and sifting

11:37.320 --> 11:42.760
through and I pray to God for no more future happiness until we find this eye.

11:42.760 --> 11:47.080
And I also kind of pray that it not be me that finds it this time.

11:47.080 --> 11:51.400
So after like an hour my cousin Kevin finds the eye and he holds it up in triumph and

11:51.400 --> 11:52.400
he does not let go.

11:52.400 --> 11:59.260
And my uncle Al takes the eye, he like washes it off and just pops it back in.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.480
And then he kind of like tests it, you know, and it's like keeping up with the other one.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.120
So it's working still.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.080
And now it's the weirdest thing because now we know it's a fake eye.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.720
And now that you know it's a fake eye, it totally looks like a fake eye.

12:10.720 --> 12:14.280
And I can't believe that I never noticed it wasn't a fake eye before.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.760
So now vacation's back on.

12:16.760 --> 12:20.380
And so everybody gets back into their beach chairs and they start to settle down to begin

12:20.380 --> 12:24.920
telling the story over and over like a million times about what I just did.

12:24.920 --> 12:29.420
And I have not really fully reintegrated back into the family yet.

12:29.420 --> 12:30.600
I'm kind of standing apart.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.560
And I notice that there actually has been like kind of a group of people who've been

12:33.560 --> 12:35.360
watching this whole thing.

12:35.360 --> 12:39.400
And then I see something that I didn't notice that no one noticed.

12:39.400 --> 12:44.840
And that's that two of the Kennedy kids, David and Michael, had taken a walk on the beach.

12:44.840 --> 12:51.280
And I can tell just by the look on their faces that they had stood there and seen the entire

12:51.280 --> 12:59.080
episode, that they had been there watching us.

12:59.080 --> 12:59.320
Thank you.

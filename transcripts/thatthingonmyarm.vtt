00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
People often ask me how I got the scar on my arm.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
And what happened was, when I was 14 years old,

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
I got really sick and no one could figure out what was wrong with me.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
I was very ill and finally, after a week of not getting better,

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
my mother took me to the hospital and I, after many tests,

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
was finally, days and days later, diagnosed with a hyper allergy,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
something called Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
And once they finally found out what was wrong with me,

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
they treated me for it, but not before I had spent weeks in the hospital,

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
weeks blind and mute, as well as being fed by tubes

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
and having to sleep sitting up so that I wouldn't choke on my own saliva.

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
My mother, in her fashion, moved in to the hospital to be by my bedside

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
and slept every night in the hospital to take care of me

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
and she wouldn't leave my side.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
And finally, when I was released on February 1st,

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
I remember it was a Friday, as we were riding home in our car,

01:37.000 --> 01:46.000
she said, I've made a promise to God that if God delivers you safely

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
out of the hospital that I would go and I would do a penance

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
and I would go to the temple and make an offering to give thanks

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
for delivering my child home safely.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
So I know you're really sick, but I'm going to see if your stepdad

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
can drive us on Sunday to the temple.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
And I just sort of nodded in my very ill way and I said okay.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
And on that Sunday, February 3rd, my stepfather and my mother and I

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
drove in our red Ford Mercury car with the black interior

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
to the Hindu temple and I was very ill.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
I was very, very weak and frail.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
And that was long enough ago, I was 14, a long time ago,

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
when they still had the front seat that was a couch seat.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
So my mother wedged me in between her and my stepdad

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
because she wanted to take care of me.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I was still really sick.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I could barely hold my head up.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I had lost a lot of weight.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
I was so weak that she said, you stay in the car, I'll do the offering.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
She went, she did the prayers, she did the flowers, she rang the bell,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
she got the food and they came back in the car

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
and she handed me this squeaky round styrofoam plate

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
with a bunch of yellow rice on it and some vegetable curry or whatever it was.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
And off we went back down the highway

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
and I remember thinking what a beautiful sunny Sunday it was.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
And I was trying desperately to concentrate on this plate of food

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
and my mother said, you know, just try and have a couple bites of it.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Just, you know, it's blessed, it's from the puja we did.

03:41.000 --> 03:50.000
And as I was eating this rice, suddenly I heard a loud bang!

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
And I looked up and I can remember the plate flying

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
and yellow rice everywhere like confetti.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
And as the rice came down, all I could see

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
was this beautiful blue sky, this crystal clear blue sky.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
No clouds, no cars, no road in front of us,

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
no trees, nothing, just endless miraculous blue sky

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
and these kind of yellow grains flying all around.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Then all of a sudden I heard another thud

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
and then I kind of heard...

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
And it was us, we were flying and then we were airborne, I realized.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
And then what stopped our fall was this tree

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
and then we kind of went down further down this embankment

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
and then finally came to a last thud

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
and there was just stillness.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
I kind of strained my neck and I could see my mother to my right

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
and we were all pinned very closely together

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
and my mother had her eyes closed and her mouth open

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
and blood was trickling out of the side of her mouth.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
And to my left, my stepfather was saying over and over again

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
this mantra of, where are we Vijay?

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
What happened Vijay? Weren't we driving Vijay?

05:41.000 --> 05:49.000
We were at the temple Vijay, Vijay, Vijay, my mother.

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
And from my mother emanated this profound and nauseating silence.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
And I started to scream at my mother.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
I started to say, Mom, are you awake? Are you awake?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
If you're awake, say something, say something, please.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
If you're not awake, I love you, Mommy, I love you.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
If you are awake, I love you, but please say something.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
And in the back of me screaming was this chorus,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
this non-stop loop of my stepfather,

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
almost like that cliche image or track that the cartoons

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
when a bird or a cartoon character is hit on the head

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
and they say, where am I? What's going on?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
That was exactly what he was doing.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And he just kept repeating this.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
And it was all of a sudden I started feeling things.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
I started feeling hot and cold and wet and sticky and itchy

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
and burning and all I could feel from my mother

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
was this silence emanating from her

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
that kept getting louder and louder, this silence.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Then I finally heard a man call down to us and say,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
are you okay? Are you okay?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I said, yes, we're alive, we're alive.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Please get help. Please, please get help.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
And then a bunch of firemen came.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
And I remember hearing the crunch of their boots

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
down the leaves, on the leaves, down the embankment.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
And they came and they kind of got, I heard chainsaws.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
I heard a helicopter in the distance approaching.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I heard blow torches.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
I would later learn that they had to use these famous things

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
called the jaws of life to cut open the roof

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
of this red Ford Mercury Zephyr.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
And so I got taken to the City of Angels

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
and my parents got taken somewhere else.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
My arm, because we were pinned so tight,

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
my arm had flown across my mother's chest.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
And so my arm was just shattered in many pieces.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
And I lay there for hours and hours,

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
not knowing what happened to my parents,

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
not knowing if my parents were okay, if my mother was alive.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
And I remember being incredibly uncomfortable

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
in a cold hospital bed with glass everywhere,

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
in every crevice of my body, under my nails, in my hair,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
in my ears, just shattered glass everywhere.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
And I remember, you know, in the emergency room,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I remember vague bits and pieces of what people said,

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
like, you know, well, I don't think it's worth doing,

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
but, you know, I questioned the mobility of that arm

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
or, well, let's leave it alone.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
And we were home. It took us a long time to heal.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
My stepfather broke his leg,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
his left leg in four places, his hip in two.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
My mother had to come home

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
and still have a hospital bed at home for weeks and months.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And we had one-to-one nursing,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
24 hours around the clock at home,

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
because, of course, my mother this time could not care for me,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
could not be by my side.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Indeed, she had her own hospital bed.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
But my mother was determined.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
They said that they weren't going to do any surgery on my arm

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
because they thought it wasn't really worth it,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
that it would probably be dormant,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
be kind of semi-lame at my side.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And, you know, I was so young,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
I could learn to do everything with my left hand.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
And so my mother was determined not to let this happen.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
And so she, from her hospital bed at home,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
ordered me to go to another orthopedist

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
whom she had found on the phone through colleagues,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
and he said, well, she's so young, we should do it.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
And he decided to do surgery on my arm,

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
and I got this very beautiful, thin scratch of a surgery incision,

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
and there was a cylindrical metal plate that was put on.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
And as my arm got better, the scar got worse.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
And, you know, I was very awkward to begin with,

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
and I was 14, I had all these hormones and feeling off about my body,

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
and I knew that the scar on my forearm was looking bad,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
and so I knew what was to come with this scar.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And so, anyway, years go by,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
and I had to have multiple surgeries on the arm

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
every time the arm got more and more better,

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
every time the scar got longer and thicker and ropier and darker.

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
And, you know, I kind of found ways to look normal while hiding it, you know.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
And I would go on dates in college,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
and I would have to really think about

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
whether I was going to wear a short-sleeve blouse or a long-sleeve blouse.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
And then I was studying abroad, and I started modeling, of all things.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
And, you know, I wasn't a fancy model.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I used it, I graduated from college,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
and then I really started modeling to pay off my college loans.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
I was a fit model, a workaday model.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
And then this weird thing happened,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
and the agency called me and they said,

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
guess what, Helmut Newton wants to shoot you.

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
And, you know, I was young, and I was like, who's Helmut Newton?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
They said, you know, Helmut Newton, the guy, and he's great.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
He does these beautiful, sexy, dangerous, edgy pictures of women,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
and he wants to shoot you.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
So, you know, before my agency would, you know,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
when they were calling around, so they'd get comments like,

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
you know, yeah, she's kind of pretty, but that scar.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Those same people were calling, going,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
can we book the girl with the scar?

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
It's amazing that somebody else, thinking you're cool,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
can make you think differently of yourself.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
And, you know, so all of a sudden I was doing all these runway shows,

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
you know, I was like doing Alberta Freddie and Herve Leger,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
and all these great, and so my salary went up,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
and, you know, all of a sudden I was the girl with the scar.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
So, you know, maybe the scar was this mixed blessing in a way, right?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Because it paid off my college loans, and, you know,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
bought me an apartment, paid off my mom's mortgage,

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
a lot of cool things, so I thought that was great.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
And I was thinking about all of this recently

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
because I found myself on my back in another hospital bed

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
staring at another white ceiling.

13:03.000 --> 13:11.000
And I was told that I would probably never have children naturally,

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
and that was very upsetting, as many women can understand, and men too.

13:17.000 --> 13:24.000
And then I got pregnant, which was a real surprise, but a happy one.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
And then I was told it would be a difficult pregnancy,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
and then it was a really difficult pregnancy,

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
and I was ordered on complete bed rest the last trimester of my pregnancy.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
And my mother, in true fashion, moved in with me the next day.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah, it's true.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
And, you know, when your mother moves in with you at 39,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
it's a completely different experience.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
But there she was, valiant in her nurturing,

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
and, you know, it was a very scary last few weeks of the pregnancy.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
I wound up going to the hospital more than once before I had the baby,

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
and one time for five days with a fetal heart monitor and tubes everywhere

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
and staring at the ceiling and thinking to myself,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
God, please get me out of here.

14:17.000 --> 14:26.000
Please deliver me and my child intact and healthy out of this hospital.

14:26.000 --> 14:34.000
I recently miraculously found myself again with my mother in another car,

14:34.000 --> 14:41.000
this time going to Flushing Queens to another temple,

14:41.000 --> 14:48.000
but this time to give thanks for the safety and delivery of my daughter.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Thank you.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
grew up in a really small town in Alabama and my sister was and is to this day a

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,940
remarkably beautiful woman and I was always really good in school so it fell

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,140
into this pattern with my family where people would say things like she's the

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,580
beauty you're the brain and among my almost anorexically petite friends

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,820
growing up at five foot five a hundred and forty pounds it was universally

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,020
acknowledged that I was a fat one the whole thing really started in first

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,640
grade I have to say there was a weigh-in in school my best friend Ann Coley who

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,420
was going to go on to become the head cheerleader of our high school hopped on

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,460
the scale and weighed 45 pounds but when I jumped on the needle cropped it creeped

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,460
up to 50 and I looked over and I could see Nan looking at me in horror not just

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,140
for me but for herself and she suggested right then and there that go on a diet

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:57,220
and so I did for the next 20 years I would never wear a bathing suit without

13
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,020
putting a t-shirt over it first I would never change at a sleepover party

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,260
without getting in the sleeping bag I would never let a lover see me naked

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,020
with the lights on and not once did I ever stand in front of my closet to pick

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,340
out an outfit with any other intention other than to look as thin as possible

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,100
now along the way well-meaning people tried to help but just made things worse

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:25,380
such as my stepmother the Baywatch extra who decided when I was 11 yeah 11 years

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,940
old she said to give me a makeover but the result was something like if you put

20
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,100
blue eyeshadow and frosty pink lipstick on a cabbage patch kid it wasn't good

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,580
but somehow I managed to get through high school and college and at age 26 I

22
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:46,260
packed up my baggage and moved to Southern California where surprisingly I

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,980
actually got better there was something about like all the just extreme views

24
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,300
people had about their body all the fake everything and the bleach blonde hair

25
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,340
that made me kind of give up I think I kind of I think I kind of threw in the

26
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,460
towel and so I joined a gym down the street because it was cheap and I

27
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,940
discovered that lifting weights could be actually fun because you would get

28
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,220
strong and then with my newfound muscle tone I put on shorts for the first time

29
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,780
ever and went for a hike which led to a run and then when food was no longer the

30
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,940
enemy I started cooking healthy food and after six months I actually lost 20

31
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,420
pounds and one day I was getting dressed to go out and I actually glanced in the

32
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,740
mirror which of course I usually avoided and I realized I almost didn't recognize

33
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,820
myself and I examined myself from head to toe standing there in my bra and

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,500
panties and discovered that actually couldn't lose any more weight and I

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,220
actually looked pretty darn good now around the same time my boyfriend was

36
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,620
back in Boston and he had decided to produce an independent film and he was

37
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,860
begging me to come back east and produce the film for him but in order to do that

38
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,460
I calculated that I was gonna have to raise $2,000 over the next four months

39
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,900
somehow extra which my $11 an hour temp job really wasn't gonna produce so I

40
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,540
went out and got a copy of the LA Times and as I was perusing the ads for like

41
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,700
you know Chuck E. Cheese night manager and you know evening legal secretary

42
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,420
work I saw an ad that said dancers wanted earn up to $500 a night now you

43
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,380
have to understand I cannot dance I'm somewhat famous I'm my friends for

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,140
having tripped over my own feet when I was in college in Boston and actually

45
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,420
knocked myself unconscious on the sidewalk it's true so I ignored it and

46
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,180
went to the other ads but I kept coming back to it like $500 a night so I threw

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,180
you on the newspaper and I ran to my room and examined my butt carefully in

48
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,180
the mirror like could it be that my butt was good enough and I picked up the phone

49
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,940
and made an appointment with a woman named Samantha now my best friend Steve

50
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,020
was very against this he said Catherine your newfound self-esteem has been too

51
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,380
long coming and too hard one for you to risk it all because some bitch down at

52
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,220
the strip club doesn't think you're good enough and I knew he was right but I

53
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,820
somehow couldn't stop I just had to see so the next day I put on my sluttiest

54
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,700
outfit and made my hair huge and put on like all the makeup I owned and I went

55
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,600
down and as I walked into the club the most beautiful woman I've ever seen to

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,220
this day was pulling herself upside down naked up a pole with grace and I was

57
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,180
like what am I doing but just then I heard someone say you must be Renee now

58
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,900
Renee was a totally insane alcoholic legal secretary that worked with and I

59
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,500
was think I was hoping to channel her so I picked that as my fake name and I said

60
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,580
yes I'm Renee and I thought that there was gonna be all these questions and I

61
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,020
had memorized this detailed like personal history that was all a lie but

62
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,980
she just took one look at me and said when can you start so while I wanted it

63
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,580
in my head I was thinking like no way I was like how about Monday and she said

64
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,580
okay over the weekend I went out and bought a brand new pair of silver

65
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,980
panties and a silver push-up bra and these really amazing silver high heels

66
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,140
and Steve was still trying to talk me out of it he was like Catherine the

67
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,260
smarter the stripper the more they hate stripping what are you gonna do when

68
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,140
some asshole comes up to you and says hey you're pretty hot do you want to give

69
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,180
me a blowjob afterwards in the parking lot you're gonna want to tell him to

70
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,740
fuck off but what you're gonna have to do is go well I'll get fired if I do that

71
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,220
they'll be fantasizing about it the entire time you're on stage I'm on stage

72
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,500
and he said do you think you can do that and I was thinking you know for $500 a

73
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:27,020
night maybe I can so so so insanely that Monday morning I actually went to work

74
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,700
at my temp job and so at five o'clock I got off and showed up at the club

75
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,700
wearing my tipping outfit which was these very baggy awful black pants a

76
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,060
little sailor top my hair very straight and my glasses and as I walked in I was

77
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,460
told to go over and tell the DJ what my song would be and I walked around I was

78
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,740
like hi I'm the new girl I'll be dancing to Alanis Morissette and he was just

79
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,820
like all right and he says the dressing rooms over there and I looked at the

80
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,180
dressing room and suddenly I realized that behind that dressing room were

81
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,100
probably ten drop-dead gorgeous women and I was like oh my god and so I looked

82
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,380
at the door and I looked at the door of the club and just then I heard hi you

83
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,060
must be the new girl I'm Chloe and that turned into my right was this little

84
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,940
Patricia Arquette sort of knockoff girl and she was wearing stars on one boob

85
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,500
and spangled on the other and one of the 70s styles bikinis with a little silver

86
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,220
skirt and she was adorable she's like I'll show you the way so Chloe grabs me

87
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,780
by the hand drags me off and leads me into the dressing room and I start

88
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,940
getting dressed for the other girls and actually the other girls were pretty

89
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,220
nice and so they explained to me the rules of the club which I hadn't known

90
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,580
before in the first place the first song you did you know in your bra and panties

91
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,180
and little whatever you wore after but the set and they're like the only the

92
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,500
second song is topless and I was like the second song is topless I think I

93
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,060
think the whole time I've been pictured that would just go out on stage and

94
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,220
flip around and let the very end I dropped my bra and run but now you had

95
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,900
to be topless for an entire song and I'm like oh no but I was like okay and like

96
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,900
they're all looking at me I can't back out so like I'm taking off my clothes

97
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,140
and everybody's just naked and so just then I'm the DJ who was just what you

98
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,900
know 300 pound man named Rudy comes into the room and he says and he's like who

99
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:15,180
girls now the girls are kind of and I didn't even care and and I realized at

100
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,980
the time that maybe I'd gone somewhere that never been before mentally and

101
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,220
maybe I was gonna get through this night so Rudy leaves and I'm starting to go

102
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,660
to the girls go no you can't wear those silver panties you have to wear a G

103
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,540
string and I was like oh no I don't have a G string well bye bye bye but

104
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,340
Janae was this leggy blonde from Texas whose claim to fame was that she's

105
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,740
stripped into her six month of pregnancy Janae says hi I just washed mine here

106
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,620
you can borrow this and she throws it at me I'm like all right so I'm putting a

107
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,220
strange girls G string and I put it on and so the girls um helped me do my hair

108
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,460
and they make a huge and they put on my makeup and like fake eyelashes and all

109
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,220
this stuff and I was ready to go and as I walked out I glanced in the mirror and

110
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:08,260
I have to say that I looked unbelievable so so so I go out and I go back out to

111
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,100
Rudy and I'm like hi I'm ready for my song and he looks at me and he's like

112
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:19,980
holy shit box all that was under there and I was like thank you so then Chloe

113
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,900
starts giving me a tour of the club and as what she's doing this this guy comes

114
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,060
up to us on crutches he claims he even shot in a gang fight and he comes up to

115
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,820
me and he goes you're pretty hot you know I'll put you in a music video if

116
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,260
you'll give me a blowjob after the show and I'm like Steve you know and Chloe

117
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,560
says you grabs jumps back and screams fuck you she's a stripper not a goddamn

118
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:48,020
whore and I was just like nice nice so then I'm so then we walk back out and

119
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,460
and it's horribly the beautiful woman from like the audition day was out on

120
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,420
stage again and she was incredible dancer and she's running around and I'm

121
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,420
just like oh my god but so I couldn't tell Chloe I'm like you know I'm really

122
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,380
a little nervous and she goes no no no you'll have no problem she's like it's

123
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,420
not the best dancers that make all the money it's the girls you can really

124
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,500
connect with the men you can look from guy to guy to guy and make the guy think

125
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,180
that they're only looking at them and it's really not being about a dancer

126
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,060
they just want to see you nude up there but the biggest problem you're gonna

127
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,980
have is that you're gonna get bored no being bored was not something that

128
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,540
occurred to me as it was gonna be a problem she's like no you know you have

129
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,660
a special trick it's called the drop and roll so what you do you know as you go

130
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,620
out there and you sort of like slowly slowly slowly slowly lower and then

131
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,680
slowly slowly slowly roll around she's like the picture you rolling around in

132
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,100
their beds and then slowly slowly slowly slowly stand back up and if you do it

133
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,420
slow enough it could take up like two minutes and I was like great so I go out

134
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:49,780
and so then Chloe has to do her song and I go and I sit down near the door and I

135
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,540
get a coke to drink because I didn't want to drink alcohol because I had to

136
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,380
drive home like I'm such a nerd and so I sit there and I'm all of a sudden like

137
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,940
it was a really cold night and the wind blew in and I got really cold of course

138
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,900
I hadn't eaten for like three days because I was so nervous you know kind

139
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,060
of like today and so I was like I started to freak out and I looked up and

140
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,900
I was just like what am I doing and so I go over to Chloe who's come off stage

141
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,140
now and she's sitting next to mr. shot and the lead guy like they've made up

142
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,620
now they're friends again and so I go over and I'm like hi you know I was a

143
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,900
you have been so great and thank you so much but I just realized that I can't

144
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,540
dance so I'm gonna go home and practice and I'm gonna come back and Chloe looked

145
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,460
at me right in the eyes and she said if you walk out of that door right now you

146
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,300
will never come back and you'll regret it for the rest of your life and I knew

147
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,260
that she was right and just then mr. shot in the lead guy reaches out like

148
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,020
under the little dress somewhere and grabs my bare ass and he sort of

149
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,340
squeezes it and he slaps me in the ass and he says you know this is the worst

150
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,020
you feel this is the worst thing that's gonna happen to you all night and he

151
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,940
smacks me goes now get up on that stage and I was like all right

152
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,260
and so so I went out on stage and you know it's all went out and I walked over

153
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,140
there was a pole and so I sort of swung around the pole and like Chloe's running

154
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,020
around getting everyone to yell and scream as your very supportive friend and

155
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,180
so like I'm running around and I'm but and then all of a sudden insanely I run

156
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,300
out of things to do and I'm like the drop and roll so I'm like lower lower

157
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,940
lower lower lower lower roll roll roll and as I'm really right I feel something

158
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,420
hit my cheek and I'm like oh my god I'm so bad they're throwing napkins at me

159
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:38,620
and I turn my head to the right on stage and I opened my eyes and I saw that it

160
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,140
was a dollar bill and I was like and so then I'm like lean back like this and I

161
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,740
see standing above me is mr. shot in the you know gang fight man and he's standing

162
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,500
over me with a roll of ones pulling them off and dropping them down on top of me

163
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,620
and all I could think was I swear to God was what would my ophthalmologist

164
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,980
father back in Alabama think if he could see me right now so um but then like

165
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,860
everyone was throwing money and it was amazing and so I got up and then it came

166
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,100
to finally be the dreaded topless song so I went to the special topless part of

167
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,180
the stage and the song started and I unhooked my bra very slowly and slowly

168
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,060
the strap and slowly the strap and then I let the bra drop to the floor and I

169
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,540
stood there in front of a hundred and fifty people wearing only a g-string the

170
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,860
whole crowd went nuts and I have to say it was one of the most amazing moments

171
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:48,340
of my entire life no one in that club gave a shit when I made them at SAT no

172
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,420
one cared that was a straight student no one cared that was in the gifted class

173
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:58,980
when I was eight if they just wanted to see me nude it was so cool I never went

174
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,780
back to the club after that night in the first place security was pretty lax Chloe

175
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:11,780
kept making like little passing marks okay Chloe Chloe kept making remarks

176
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,660
about how only a few of her friends have been killed by customers which I found

177
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,780
disconcerting but the worst part was at the next day at work walking across the

178
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,260
Sony lot I suddenly was examining every strange man that passed me I was

179
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,140
noticing them and checking them out and I've always been one of the any seem

180
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,900
kind of yucky to me I was sort of it's like every man was suddenly a customer

181
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,060
and I've always known those women that really loves men and I thought if this

182
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,940
is where I'm like after three hours what am I gonna be like after three months or

183
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,180
three years but several good things came out of it in the first place one of the

184
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,060
customers taught me this really cool trick which is the guy is pawing you you

185
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,020
hold his hand because he thinks you're holding his hand but what you're doing

186
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,100
is you're holding his hand off of you this came in super handy the next

187
00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:01,340
summer in my career as a film producer but the best thing of all is that to

188
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:07,300
this day anytime I'm having a fat day or I've just broken up with someone or I'm

189
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,220
just feeling a little down about myself all I have to do is open the door and

190
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,140
peek into the back of the closet where I still keep those silver high heels and I

191
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:20,740
know in my heart that everything is gonna be okay thank you

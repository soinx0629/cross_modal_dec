1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Under the Influence is our topic tonight.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,920
And I thought of a lot of different things.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,480
And the one I kind of wanted to talk about was my secret influence.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,140
There are people in our lives that are incredibly important to us.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,660
And I would even mention to say some of the most important people, everybody aside

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,780
from my mother in my life, doesn't know anything about this person who I think

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,500
about every day, and his name was Michael Marquis.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,580
And so if this were a violin piece, it would be called Ode to Michael Marquis.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,540
I met him when I was seven years old.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,580
And I was growing up, my mother had left my father when I was about two or three.

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:47,020
And this was the first man that my mother had brought home, like for me to meet.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,400
And he was a Vietnam vet.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,200
He was a professional athlete.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,860
He had played college football, college baseball.

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,440
He was a ski instructor and a golf instructor.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,300
He had like a big beard, and he drank scotch, and he had a German shepherd, and he had a lab,

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,920
and he had this unbelievable MG.

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,940
And not like those little like wussy MG's that you see, like it was like a 1933 MG.

19
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,000
It was like a motorcycle.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,000
I mean, this thing was so cool.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,660
And the doors like went super low, you know.

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,280
I mean, it was just so cool.

23
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,760
And he was so cool.

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:31,620
And he was the first person to really tap into, he may have tapped into it,

25
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,840
he may have created it, I'm not sure, but a mama's boy complex.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,220
Which was that I had, I hadn't been, my father lived in Texas,

27
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,580
and I hadn't been to Texas since I was about three, but I was obsessed.

28
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,180
I had a Dallas Cowboys belt buckle.

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,320
I would wear like, you know, flower t-shirts, you know,

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,520
like Grand Parsons or something like that.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,480
I mean, this is about 1977.

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
I was very into that.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,840
I only listened to Willie Nelson's The Red-Headed Stranger.

34
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,860
My room was covered with cowboys and broncos and Indians,

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,120
and like anything Texas was up my alley.

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,900
And he met me, and he's like, why, what's all the Texas stuff, you know?

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,280
He's like, well, you know, my dad lives in Texas.

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,540
Well, he ain't here, is he?

39
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,280
I'm like, no.

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,580
He's like, well, I think I'd get over the Texas thing if I were you.

41
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,440
I'd be like, you know, that really hurt my feelings.

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,400
And he proceeded to like latch into this thing, like, so what, are you mama's boy?

43
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,620
Cowboys lost today.

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,980
Did your dad call?

45
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,360
No, right?

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,160
I mean, he's a very tough guy, very tough guy.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,660
And through a little bit of what my mother felt was kind of abusive behavior,

48
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,000
I grew to love him, right?

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,100
I mean, I hated him, but I loved him.

50
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,400
I thought about him all the time and what he would think about something.

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,580
And like, for example, he decided that since I was so into football,

52
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,340
but you don't know how to play football, you know?

53
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,140
What, did your dad teach you to play football?

54
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
No, I don't think he did, did he?

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,360
All right, come on, let's play football.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,140
No, I'm not looking for the pity thing.

57
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,120
It was really pretty funny.

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,520
I mean, he was a funny guy.

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,260
He was trying to help me in his own weird way.

60
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,620
So he takes me outside, he takes me outside, and he says, all right,

61
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,060
I'm going to teach you how to play football, all right?

62
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,840
But football is a man's game, it's not a mama's boy's game, all right?

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,220
You make a diamond with your hands, your thumb to your four fingers,

64
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,320
and if you can touch it, you can catch it, all right?

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,080
So I'm like, all right.

66
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,740
Bam! You know, and I was, and he's like, you still with me?

67
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,740
You still want to play football?

68
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,420
Huh? I'm like, yeah, I want to play football.

69
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,180
He's like, all right, if you can touch it, you can catch it, all right?

70
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,140
Bam! You know, and it just went on.

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:03,180
I mean, and it was freezing outside, and my nose is bleeding, and I'm crying,

72
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,600
and I want to go inside, and he's like, you know, you've got to catch this football, right?

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,640
And so finally, I catch it, like, three times.

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,060
He's like, all right, see, you're not such a little mama's boy, after all,

75
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,700
and I feel kind of good about myself.

76
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,600
I mean, you know, I don't want to have me go figure, you know?

77
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:24,880
So my mom really liked him, and we moved to Vermont, and he took us,

78
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,780
and he moved us into this one bedroom, one, not, it was just a one room cabin in Vermont,

79
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:37,220
whereas he had this gig as a ski instructor, and it was really picturesque,

80
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,980
and he really had it in his heart, like, to teach me how to be a man, you know?

81
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,700
And we would, he taught me how to chop wood, and he bought me a jeans jacket,

82
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,820
and he would have my mom do, like, patches on the back, you know, and it was really very cool,

83
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,040
and I started to feel very cool.

84
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:03,040
He took me to see The Man Who Would Be King, and, you know, I cried at the end,

85
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,640
which is, this is a digression, I'm going to regret doing this, but it's my favorite line,

86
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,000
since I have an audience, I have to tell you, it's like, Sean Connery is standing

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,840
on the burning bridge, and Michael Caine shouts, he's, the bridge is burning, he's going to die,

88
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,360
and Michael Caine scouts out, you know, peachy, will you ever forgive me for being so bleeding,

89
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:27,360
so stupid, and so bloody arrogant, and Sean Connery says, you know, that I can, and that I do, you know?

90
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
And, like, Michael and I sat there, and I just cried, and he was just like,

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
pull yourself together, man, you know?

92
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,360
We got in the car, a guy's a little M.G., and it's, like, freezing, and I'm crying, and he's like, come on!

93
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:48,360
It was a good movie, it was sad, but it was, you know, you gotta, you know, I loved it, too, I loved it, too.

94
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,360
But from then on, in my mind, like, Michael and I were, you know,

95
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Michael Caine and Sean Connery on adventures and things, and we had them, you know?

96
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,360
I mean, I had to walk, I mean, it's really kind of picturesque, I had to walk, like, two miles to school,

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,360
and I was only in second grade, and it was very fun, he insisted that I do it, you know, by myself,

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,360
and my mother had a lot of problems with him, like, the, the, like, when my mother would go,

99
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,360
she had to go to town a couple times, and he would take me on dates with other women,

100
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,360
and, like, if you tell your mother, I'm gonna kick your ass, and I thought it was great.

101
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I mean, again, like, you keep being judgmental, and I was like, I was like, this guy is so cool.

102
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,360
And I remember I, like, rolled joints for him for this other girl.

103
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,360
I don't know, I have this vague memory of it, but, and finally, like, my most pivotal memory of him,

104
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,360
aside from the closing of my story, is, is we had, you know, this little one-room cabin,

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,360
I mean, it was really, really idyllic, snow, and Vermont, and all this other stuff,

106
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,360
and, and Michael, we're out on this little deck outside of it, and Michael's like,

107
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,360
see that, look at that buck, look at that buck, look at that, get the shotgun, Ethan, get the shotgun,

108
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,360
you know, and I'm like, I'm like, what for? He's like, we're gonna kill it, you know,

109
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,360
and I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, Mom, Michael's gonna kill a buck, Michael's gonna kill a buck!

110
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,360
And Michael goes, you, I was gonna let you shoot it.

111
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,360
You blew it, you know, and I didn't know how I felt, because I didn't want to shoot it,

112
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,360
but now I felt like I should have wanted to shoot it, and like, I don't know, I felt very strange.

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Doesn't exactly make sense, but you can understand the subconscious, very influenced.

114
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,360
And so, finally one day, I come walking home from school, this little cabin,

115
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,360
and all my mother's underwear and lingerie, kind of like things,

116
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,360
are nailed to the outside of the house, right? This is a true story, all right?

117
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:52,360
And I'm like, wow, that's weird, you know? And, and, and, and inside there's like,

118
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,360
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

119
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,360
And, you know, we basically get in a car and we're gone.

120
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,360
And we move to Atlanta, Georgia.

121
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,360
And, you know, I don't know any more about what happened there than you do.

122
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,360
I mean, long charade, I can guess, you know, but I've never asked my mom,

123
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,360
my mom has a lot of issues, but that's not, this is Michael's ode.

124
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,360
And so anyway, we move to Atlanta, Georgia, and what happens is,

125
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,360
my father gets remarried, and for some reason, to my now eight-year-old mind,

126
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,360
this is very disturbing.

127
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,360
I'm not invited to the wedding, and I'm very upset about this,

128
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,360
and it's kind of throwing my whole Texas fantasy scheme apart.

129
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,360
And I get, but I'm in this like weird school in Atlanta, Georgia,

130
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,360
and I actually get accepted to this little gifted and talented program,

131
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
like for an eight-year-old, right?

132
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,360
And I go to, and I get kicked out on the second day

133
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,360
because I told some kid that his painting sucked, right?

134
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Or the teacher, I didn't get kicked out right away.

135
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,360
I had to write a one-page essay about why I would, you know,

136
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,360
I was supposed to write about why saying somebody's painting sucked was a bad thing.

137
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,360
And I wrote in my essay that I didn't know that it was something bad

138
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,360
because my mother goes out with lots of guys,

139
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,360
and the last one that she dated told me I sucked all the time,

140
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
and I didn't think it was that big a deal.

141
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Now, that sounds like, the truth is, I knew exactly what I was doing.

142
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Like, it wasn't like I was trying to make my mom look bad in front of the teachers

143
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
to like deflect, you know, me being in trouble.

144
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
My mom was so angry at me.

145
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
She got this call from the teacher, and she hangs up,

146
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,360
you little shit, you know?

147
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,360
Well, I don't date lots of guys, and Michael didn't say you sucked.

148
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Yes, he did. All right, he did.

149
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
But, you know, like, blah, blah, blah.

150
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,360
And anyway, the point is, and then I got in a fight,

151
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,360
and I got kicked out of this gifted and talented thing,

152
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,360
and it was like a big deal, and my father's getting remarried,

153
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
and they send me to a child psychologist,

154
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,360
and my mom comes up with this idea that she's going to invite Michael to come to my birthday,

155
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,360
like that I could really use this, right?

156
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
But I don't know about this, but so my birthday arrives,

157
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,360
and we're living in Atlanta, Georgia now,

158
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,360
and who comes down the street in a little MG with the golden retriever

159
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,360
right in the side of the thing, and his hair and his beard,

160
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,360
and he's got this, you know, thing and a bunch of presents in the back,

161
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,360
comes pulling up, and it was really one of the greatest moments in my life.

162
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
I mean, I was so happy to see him,

163
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,360
and I had all these boys come over for my birthday party,

164
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,360
and Michael took turns taking us around the block,

165
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,360
and he would like peel out fishtail around the thing,

166
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
and my mother would be screaming,

167
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Michael, get him in, and all the boys would be like,

168
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,360
your dad is so cool.

169
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,360
And I'd be like, I know, I know, he's so cool.

170
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
And it was really one of those glorious days.

171
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Michael took us all to Chuck E. Cheese's,

172
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,360
and we went to see George Burns in Oh God,

173
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,360
and everybody was just so into Michael,

174
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,360
and I, by association, was a very studly guy.

175
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,360
And so then it's the night's over, and Michael's going to leave.

176
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,360
You know, Michael says goodbye, and I say, all right, see you later,

177
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
and he starts to go, and I go to my room, and I start sobbing, right?

178
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,360
And so my mother comes in, and it's like, what are you crying about?

179
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,360
It's like nothing, nothing, you know, I just,

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
I wish Michael was going to stay longer, you know,

181
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
and she's like, all right,

182
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,360
and she goes outside, and okay, but yeah, go, go, go.

183
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,360
And it's very good, very good timing, very good timing.

184
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Like Pat Riley would say, it's all good.

185
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,360
So much for him.

186
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:03,360
But so Michael comes into my room, and I'm devastated,

187
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
because as much as I would like,

188
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
and everything for him to talk to me and everything,

189
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,360
I am so upset, you know,

190
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,360
and I really don't want him to see me like this, you know?

191
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,360
And he tells me that, you know, he's going to stay in touch with me,

192
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,360
and that don't worry, you know, my mom's a pain in the ass,

193
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,360
we all know that, but I'm going to stay in touch with you,

194
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,360
you're a great kid, you know, and he might have even told me he loved me.

195
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
I mean, he was really being really nice.

196
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,360
And he drove from Vermont to Georgia for a day.

197
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:44,360
And so, and then he leaves, and you know, like I watch him drive away,

198
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,360
it's like night now, and I watch the MG and the golden retriever like take off,

199
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,360
and my mom comes back in the house and I hear it,

200
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,360
and I just scream out the room like, I am never going to speak to you again.

201
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,360
You know, I felt so betrayed by her, because if Michael was going to leave,

202
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,360
I wanted him to think I didn't care, you know?

203
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,360
And he, and I never saw him again, you know?

204
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,360
And I got a message, my mother got a message about two or three years ago,

205
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,360
something that she Googled Michael Marquis.

206
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,360
No, she didn't, that she had heard from him,

207
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,360
and that like he saw some movie I did and thought that I was doing really great.

208
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,360
It really meant a lot to me because, you know, nobody I know knows him,

209
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
but I carry him with me every day.

210
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,360
And he's been the secret influence of my life.

211
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Thank you.

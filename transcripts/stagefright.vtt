WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.520
So it starts in 1989 and it's July and I'm on tour with my band and we're

00:06.520 --> 00:10.520
touring through Europe and this is a very usual thing I had been touring for

00:10.520 --> 00:16.560
years and years seven or eight years by that point so it we had just come from

00:16.560 --> 00:21.920
Israel and we had landed in the UK in England so I had never been to Israel

00:21.920 --> 00:25.800
before and the first time you go there all the security is a bit daunting you

00:25.800 --> 00:29.680
know they search you and they search you again and they ask you questions and I

00:29.680 --> 00:34.760
found it a little scary so even though I really enjoyed my time there I was

00:34.760 --> 00:39.680
looking forward to coming back to England which was very familiar to me so

00:39.680 --> 00:44.680
this was we just landed in England we were staying at the Holiday Inn Airport

00:44.680 --> 00:53.360
near Heathrow very glamorous so I wake up that morning and that night I'm going

00:53.360 --> 00:58.620
to play at the Glastonbury Festival in Glastonbury so we have a journey to go

00:58.660 --> 01:03.020
to and it's probably going to be the biggest audience I'm ever going to face

01:03.020 --> 01:09.020
where there's supposed to be 75,000 or 80,000 people there and I'm headlining

01:09.020 --> 01:13.540
that night it's a Friday night so I'm the last act on the show and all this is

01:13.540 --> 01:19.860
okay this is fine I pack my stuff I go downstairs to the to the front desk and

01:19.860 --> 01:24.340
there's some kind of altercation at the desk and I see my bass player Mikey and

01:24.340 --> 01:27.500
he's looking really unhappy he's looking really pale and he's like I have Puerto

01:27.580 --> 01:32.860
Rico and half Italian so pale is not his usual color so I am concerned about this

01:32.860 --> 01:37.580
and then I also see my tour manager also looking really upset my manager there's

01:37.580 --> 01:42.180
all this kind of buzzing going on I'm like what's going on so we all knew that

01:42.180 --> 01:46.940
there had been some girl that had a crush on Mike you know and this happens

01:46.940 --> 01:49.940
from time to time you know girls fall in love with the guys in the band and I

01:49.940 --> 01:55.940
try and stay out of it you know and they send things or whatever and I try and lay

01:55.940 --> 01:59.380
down rules you know we don't want random girls on the bus but you can have your

01:59.380 --> 02:05.020
girlfriend or you can have your wife random girls off the bus but I kind of

02:05.020 --> 02:09.100
knew about this random girl because she it started off with little gifts that

02:09.100 --> 02:12.140
were coming backstage from Mike email thought that was really cute and then

02:12.140 --> 02:19.820
after that graduated to pictures of herself naked and well whatever so but

02:19.820 --> 02:24.860
then we all became worried because she had actually moved to Queens from London

02:24.860 --> 02:29.500
to be near him when we were not on tour and we all felt that that was going too

02:29.500 --> 02:35.620
far so now it turned out that now we're back in the UK and we are going to play

02:35.620 --> 02:40.980
Glastonbury and she has called him in the middle of the night and made these

02:40.980 --> 02:46.700
threats and said to him that she she and her friend who is a male guy who was

02:46.700 --> 02:51.820
also calling the hotel we're going to shoot him if he went out on stage that

02:51.820 --> 03:02.860
night so I'm like oh god I hate I hate that kind of day because I just want to

03:02.860 --> 03:06.220
be in England where it's just nice you know and it was comfortable and it was

03:06.220 --> 03:10.860
you know and Glastonbury is a festival of hippies basically they have a big

03:10.860 --> 03:15.580
peace sign on the stage so and I'm thinking is this really gonna happen but

03:15.580 --> 03:20.500
my manager feels that we should take it seriously so we call Scotland Yard so

03:20.500 --> 03:25.940
we're all waiting for Mr. Scotland Yard to show up the detective shows up and he

03:25.940 --> 03:29.580
takes the trip with us on the bus Mike is freaking out everybody's freaking out

03:29.580 --> 03:36.060
so and I'm like okay so he asks us some questions he finds out some things about

03:36.060 --> 03:40.500
this girl he finds out some things about the other man who was making the calls

03:40.500 --> 03:45.620
and this kind of thing so the tension is kind of building it's a long trip and we

03:45.620 --> 03:48.820
finally get there and we wind our way through this crowd of people and we're

03:48.860 --> 03:52.340
trying to find our way backstage to where the bus is supposed to be and it's

03:52.340 --> 03:56.060
kind of muddy I think it had rained and then it had stopped raining so now

03:56.060 --> 04:00.340
there's all this dust and stuff in the air and as throngs of people and we're

04:00.340 --> 04:05.900
trying to find our way backstage and once we get there I feel that I I need

04:05.900 --> 04:10.580
to go for a walk I need a little privacy and I try and go for a walk I figure

04:10.580 --> 04:13.900
I'll check out some of the booths that are selling tie-dyed things and military

04:13.900 --> 04:18.700
surplus Mr. Scotland Yard wants to walk with me and I'm like no no it's okay

04:18.860 --> 04:22.460
you know you stay with Mike I'll be fine no miss Vega I feel I really should come

04:22.460 --> 04:27.060
with you no I don't want you to come with me you can stay with Mike I need to

04:27.060 --> 04:35.500
go off and he said no so I said okay fine I'll stay here then we were gonna

04:35.500 --> 04:42.860
go on stage at about 11 o'clock at about 930 suddenly four or five policemen show

04:42.860 --> 04:46.260
up and they come onto the bus and they want to have a little chat with me and

04:46.820 --> 04:50.740
I'm like why you know Mike will be fine he's gonna perform on the side of the

04:50.740 --> 04:55.020
stage we have two bodyguards for Mike he's gonna perform in a bulletproof vest

04:55.020 --> 04:58.860
he's got the two bodyguards are there one looks like mr. clean and one looks

04:58.860 --> 05:02.700
like GI Joe and they're very handsome guys and they're gonna defend Mike's I'm

05:02.700 --> 05:07.700
like great what's the problem so the policemen sit me down and they said well

05:07.700 --> 05:12.020
we didn't want to tell you this because we were we didn't want to upset you but

05:12.020 --> 05:16.220
your life was also threatened they also said miss Vega if you go out on stage

05:16.220 --> 05:20.580
you will also get it so being that we have tracked down the woman but we

05:20.580 --> 05:26.260
haven't tracked down her accomplice we feel that we need to inform you legally

05:26.260 --> 05:30.180
that you should not do this show tonight we feel that you should not perform on

05:30.180 --> 05:37.340
stage tonight so I'm like what are you kidding like this is Friday night I'm

05:37.340 --> 05:41.060
headlining the Glastonbury festival there's like a hundred thousand people

05:41.060 --> 05:44.500
what do you mean I'm not gonna do the show of course I'm gonna do the show you

05:44.540 --> 05:47.380
know the show must go on what are you talking about no one's gonna like shoot

05:47.380 --> 05:54.500
me on the Glastonbury stage under the peace sign so and then I'm thinking well

05:54.500 --> 06:00.300
anyway you don't want to know what I was thinking so so I said no no I'm said I

06:00.300 --> 06:04.580
really have to do the show I feel that I really must and my my keyboard player

06:04.580 --> 06:07.580
who's also my boyfriend is looking at me with tears in his eyes and he's like no

06:07.580 --> 06:11.700
no I don't think you should do it I'm like I'm sorry we have to do it how can

06:11.700 --> 06:16.260
we possibly come back to England if we don't do this show you know any crazy

06:16.260 --> 06:21.020
person can call up on the phone and say you know whatever they're gonna say and

06:21.020 --> 06:25.740
then we they everybody would know that we cancelled so they said okay well

06:25.740 --> 06:30.460
you'll have to wear the bulletproof vest as well so I said okay the only one they

06:30.460 --> 06:36.140
had was his and this policeman was about 250 pounds and I'm like half that size

06:36.140 --> 06:41.100
so they put it on me and it's enormous and he strapped me in and they gaffers

06:41.100 --> 06:45.780
tape it closed so I'm like okay and I'm like can I still play the guitar I think

06:45.780 --> 06:50.460
so and then I have a they put a huge denim jacket on over that so no one

06:50.460 --> 06:54.740
sees the bulletproof vest so now I'm all decked out like a turtle like this and

06:54.740 --> 06:58.700
my arms are kind of like this I'm like okay but you know I felt really strongly

06:58.700 --> 07:02.220
that we should we should go on we should risk our lives you know this is rock and

07:02.220 --> 07:09.660
roll this is what this is what we do so I remember that moment as I was walking

07:09.660 --> 07:14.340
out on the stage and I see the microphone there and I'm in my denim

07:14.340 --> 07:19.820
jacket and my gaffers tape and my bulletproof vest and things start to

07:19.820 --> 07:24.700
feel like I'm going underwater and as I'm heading for the microphone the

07:24.700 --> 07:28.020
thought suddenly occurs to me that they could shoot me in the head and I'm like

07:28.020 --> 07:31.620
oh I wish I hadn't thought that right now but I not thinking about that anymore

07:31.620 --> 07:35.400
I'm just heading for the microphone and then I pick up the guitar and I start

07:35.400 --> 07:40.680
singing and the other thing that happened was that now this whole

07:40.680 --> 07:44.840
situation has escalated to the point where there's 20 policemen in front of

07:44.840 --> 07:49.840
the stage there's a hundred thousand people behind them there's people as far

07:49.840 --> 07:53.460
as the eye can see from the stage all the way to the horizon this is like

07:53.460 --> 07:58.720
several villages or something not only that but there's helicopters overhead

07:58.720 --> 08:03.640
and they've decided to train the lights not on the stage which they usually do

08:03.640 --> 08:07.880
but from time to time they swivel the lights onto the audience to search them

08:07.880 --> 08:13.120
to see if they see anyone with a weapon so I'm singing every song feels like

08:13.120 --> 08:18.440
it's taking 20 minutes long small blue thing just seems to go on forever and

08:18.440 --> 08:21.920
I'm looking at every so often they swivel the lights onto the audience and

08:21.920 --> 08:26.740
I'm like you know and I continue to play and every so often I turn around to look

08:26.740 --> 08:31.280
at Mike of course he's not there you know Mike is over there with mr. clean

08:31.280 --> 08:37.360
the GI Joe and there's the his amplifier on the floor so it's like

08:37.360 --> 08:43.720
where's Mike oh there's his amp so blah blah I'm playing it's all going pretty

08:43.720 --> 08:51.480
well I'm thinking wow this is great that we're alive and suddenly my keyboard

08:51.480 --> 08:56.000
player approaches me and he says sing Luca and get off stage and I'm like why

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
and he goes I can't tell you right now but we have to get off stage by 1230

09:01.480 --> 09:06.040
and I'm like okay and then I start thinking well why do they want me to get

09:06.040 --> 09:09.320
off stage did they find some did they find the weapon did they find the girl

09:09.320 --> 09:12.560
did they find her accomplice maybe I should just get off stage and not sing

09:12.560 --> 09:18.280
Luca Luca was my big hit at that point and it was and I decided no we're gonna

09:18.280 --> 09:21.120
stay we're gonna sing Luca we're gonna entertain everybody I've come to be

09:21.120 --> 09:25.480
entertained we have to do this I sing Luca everybody's cheering I come off

09:25.480 --> 09:30.920
stage it feels like it's going in slow motion and I said what happened did they

09:30.920 --> 09:35.920
find the girl no did they find her accomplice no they find somebody with a

09:35.920 --> 09:41.560
weapon no well why did we have to get off stage at 1230 and then the promoter

09:41.560 --> 09:44.440
of the festival comes over to me and says with Miss Vega we didn't get a

09:44.440 --> 09:48.640
chance to explain this to you before but the festival has a curfew because the

09:48.640 --> 09:53.760
farmers in the next field have the cows and the cows get disturbed if you sing

09:53.760 --> 10:03.560
past 1230 and it makes them less productive and that's my story

Tom Waits loved the novel J.T. Leroy had written called Sarah. He wanted to do an

00:15.520 --> 00:26.920
interview with J.T. Leroy for Vanity Fair magazine and he wanted J.T.'s input on who

00:26.960 --> 00:37.440
would photograph the spread because J.T. Leroy was notoriously shy. One of the reasons why

00:37.440 --> 00:49.800
J.T. was so shy was because J.T. didn't have a body. J.T. was an avatar. So let me take you

00:49.800 --> 01:00.000
back some years. I was 16, 17 years old and I was awarded the state in a group home in

01:00.000 --> 01:14.200
New York City. Eight girls, one bathroom. And the girls had all had stories being some had

01:14.200 --> 01:23.240
been raped, stabbed by a parent, sold into slavery. Everyone had secrets. At night time,

01:23.240 --> 01:31.240
we'd tell our secrets and you couldn't tell. And I was the one they would come to and tell

01:31.240 --> 01:38.560
their stories. And if you asked me why I was there, I don't know. All the intakes,

01:38.640 --> 01:50.520
dysfunctional family, I dropped out of school, I don't know. But I was always interested in

01:50.520 --> 01:57.040
how do you tell? And there was this movie, Streetwise, it was a documentary by Mariel and Mark

01:57.040 --> 02:06.360
about homeless kids in Seattle. And I gathered up some of my friends, my best friend Lauren from

02:06.360 --> 02:13.640
the group home. We'd been institutionalized together prior to the group home. And we went

02:13.640 --> 02:25.760
and saw this movie. And we saw ourselves on the screen. Now the street can seduce you. And these

02:25.760 --> 02:36.040
kids were getting swallowed. And we knew we were just one step removed. And when we left the movie,

02:36.040 --> 02:42.120
I saw how people looked at us right before they were kind of scared of us. And I got off on that,

02:42.120 --> 02:49.160
you know, because we'd street all over us. But after the movie, they looked at us with this kind

02:49.160 --> 02:58.960
of curious compassion. And suddenly, I didn't want to be the victim in the movie. I was interested

02:58.960 --> 03:04.840
in how do you make that bridge so people suddenly care and curious enough to maybe

03:05.080 --> 03:15.920
care? How do you do that? And in the group home, everyone's telling their stories. And I don't even

03:15.920 --> 03:23.360
know how to tell mine. I don't even have the tools to tell mine. And I would go to buy a little relief

03:23.360 --> 03:31.040
to a street corner. There's a phone booth right on the corner. And I would remove it from me. I'd be

03:31.040 --> 03:38.240
a boy. And I'd call hotlines. And I'd tell them all the stories, my story, my pain, everyone's

03:38.240 --> 03:44.160
stories, the houseparent who survived the Biafran Wars, and say to me, Laura, your job is to tell

03:44.160 --> 03:50.840
our stories. Because in the group home, my job was I was the translator. So some girls having some

03:50.840 --> 03:56.000
problems with the houseparent, they'd come to me and I would translate between what each other was

03:56.000 --> 04:07.120
saying. Again, if you asked me, I don't know. All I knew is if you heard what my story was,

04:07.120 --> 04:16.880
my deepest belief was that you would say, well, you deserve it. You're disgusting. You're horrible.

04:17.760 --> 04:27.120
My deepest hope was that you wouldn't. But I never ever gave you the chance. But I wanted to learn the

04:27.120 --> 04:35.400
tools to tell because that's the bridge. And I won a scholarship to the New School for Social Research.

04:35.400 --> 04:41.000
And they let me in without the SATs. I said, I can't take the SATs. My last grade of completion is

04:41.000 --> 04:52.320
six. And they let me in with an essay. I'm taking every writing class I can get my hands on. And I

04:52.320 --> 04:59.840
wrote this piece in this class about, you can tell a kid that's not going to survive long on the street

04:59.840 --> 05:06.840
because the scars run this way. And the kids are there wrapped in wrapped, you know. And everyone's

05:06.920 --> 05:15.080
looking to see whose exterior matches the story. And everyone's looking at this one cool guy. He's

05:15.080 --> 05:22.200
all raggedy. And I'm in the group home. And I'm just looking. I'm looking at him too. And I want it to be

05:22.200 --> 05:27.880
him because he matches the voice. And I don't want them to know it's me because it's going to ruin it.

05:29.400 --> 05:35.000
I want it to be him. And then when they leave, because they don't know it was anonymous reading

05:35.000 --> 05:41.640
the story. And then when we leave, I hear people talking about, wow, I never thought of it that way.

05:41.640 --> 05:49.800
I didn't know that about the scene. And I'm like, that's what I want. How do you get people to see

05:49.800 --> 06:02.400
what they never saw before? They never knew before. I keep writing, but never as myself. The writing

06:02.400 --> 06:18.880
gives me a little more relief. I start writing under the name Jeremy, which becomes JT. For me,

06:21.360 --> 06:28.240
I buy myself another day every time I can find a way to tell, but as long

06:28.240 --> 06:37.120
as it's not coming from me, never as a woman. So when I get asked by Tom Waits,

06:37.120 --> 06:45.440
when he asked JT Leroy who he wants to photograph, Mary Ellen Mark, my sister-in-law came over one day

06:45.440 --> 06:53.280
and she just shaved her head. And I'm looking at her and she looks like the blonde hair, blue-eyed

06:53.280 --> 06:57.600
little boys that I would see in the after school specials when they were just starting to talk

06:57.600 --> 07:05.920
about abuse, sexual abuse. Always a blonde hair, blue-eyed cute little boy that you would forgive

07:05.920 --> 07:12.800
and love no matter what they did, no matter how transgressive and bad they were. You just love them.

07:13.840 --> 07:26.240
I never saw myself represented in any of that. So she looked. She was JT. And she agreed to be my

07:26.240 --> 07:33.600
avatar. Now, Mary Ellen Mark said that the person she was photographing did not feel like somebody

07:33.600 --> 07:40.560
who had suffered, like someone. It felt like someone who maybe came from privilege, but she said the

07:40.560 --> 07:50.640
books needed to be in the world, that the book showed a world she had never seen, that she wanted

07:50.640 --> 08:04.400
the books to be out there. And she photographed the avatar. I continued to publish under the name JT

08:04.400 --> 08:17.840
Leroy. I wrote the book Sarah, which was received with great acclaim. I published it as fiction,

08:17.840 --> 08:32.800
all my work as fiction. Came to pass that this book that explored the wilds of West Virginia,

08:33.440 --> 08:39.360
a state I had never been in, in this kind of magical, I play with gender and identity and

08:39.360 --> 08:47.680
it's the spirit, everything that I had experienced, all the pain, all the suffering, the joy, the hope,

08:48.160 --> 08:54.000
holding on to finding that a possibility of being saved no matter what, the spirit,

08:54.640 --> 09:04.400
the humor, it was all in there turned upside down. In this book, Sarah came to pass that I am revealed

09:04.400 --> 09:16.240
as JT Leroy. The articulation in the New York Times is hoax, perpetrator, culprit, the jig is up,

09:16.240 --> 09:26.880
come clean, liar, fake fiction writer. No, New York Times, fake fiction writer.

09:31.360 --> 09:35.440
Oscar Wilde said, give a man a mask and he'll tell you the truth.

09:36.000 --> 09:44.880
I received death threats, hate mail, was blacklisted, sued in federal f*****g court.

09:50.640 --> 09:57.440
People didn't understand why I wouldn't apologize. She won't apologize. I wouldn't,

09:58.160 --> 10:03.440
how could you apologize for what kept, it kept me alive? I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it.

10:03.440 --> 10:09.040
It kept me alive. I couldn't do it another way. I knew no other way.

10:13.440 --> 10:20.160
Slowly the fan mail came back. I would get letters where people would talk about what the work meant

10:20.160 --> 10:26.640
to it, how it transformed them, how it saved their lives, how it allowed them to see a world

10:26.640 --> 10:35.840
that they had never seen before. I got invited to speak, welcome back into the community of artists,

10:36.960 --> 10:44.400
to speak all over the world. In spring, I did a sold out reading at Foyles in London

10:47.040 --> 10:50.480
and I'm signing books as me

10:51.360 --> 10:58.400
and these collectors are there and, you know, I'm signing books where, editions in languages

10:58.400 --> 11:06.400
that I didn't even know existed and sign this, sign this, sign this and I'm leaving my body

11:09.760 --> 11:13.360
and all of a sudden the crowds kind of part

11:14.240 --> 11:22.480
and this girl comes walking towards me. She's big and she's got cuts all over her arms.

11:23.680 --> 11:30.480
She's carrying a bag and I know what's coming. It's what I've been preparing for my whole life.

11:33.520 --> 11:37.120
She reaches in her bag and I know she's going to stab me

11:37.920 --> 11:47.040
and she takes out a book and she tells me that she came to my work after the reveal.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.400
She asks me to sign her diary.

11:55.360 --> 11:59.040
She asks me to sign her diary.

12:05.120 --> 12:14.400
I realize that everything that had happened up to that moment had prepared me for this

12:17.200 --> 12:18.000
and I got up

12:20.640 --> 12:21.600
and I held her.

12:24.400 --> 12:34.000
Thank you.

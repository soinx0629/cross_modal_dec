0	8120	Where I grew up in the South, there was a right way to do things and a wrong way to
8120	10400	do things.
10400	15440	And the right way was to do what your family and society thought you should do.
15440	19560	And the wrong way was to do something different.
19560	23000	By age 30, I'd done most everything I was supposed to do.
23000	25120	I'd overachieved in high school.
25120	27720	I attended a prestigious college in the South.
28200	32960	I had a good job, and I'd married well within the childbearing age.
32960	39880	We'd married at my insistence, of course, but neither one of us was fully on board.
39880	45320	So except for moving up north to Boston, which caused my family to collectively take to their
45320	50840	beds, I was on track with what we thought my life should look like, but I wasn't happy,
50840	53600	and I thought it was my career.
53600	56880	In my family, I was expected to go into business.
56920	60640	I'd been in public relations for seven years, but I didn't like the work anymore.
60640	65160	I mean, I was good at it, but I was tired of working with clients, and plus I was working
65160	72480	with companies like retail banking, traffic reporting, hazardous waste recycling, nothing
72480	75680	that really blew my skirt up.
75680	80560	So I quit my full-time job, and I started consulting, and I started taking classes to
80560	83200	figure out what else I could do for a living.
83200	88080	Now, the only criterion for the classes was that the instructors and students could not
88080	91480	know or care what the Financial Times was.
91480	95600	I took needlepoint, directing, French.
95600	99920	I found this brochure for the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and I thought,
99920	102120	oh, well, this looks interesting.
102120	105760	And I went to the school, and I talked to the continuing education director, and I asked
105760	111960	him which class he thought I should take, and he said, you need to take art as process.
112000	116720	We take burnout executives in that class all the time.
116720	119040	I sign up.
119040	121200	It's my first day of art school.
121200	128080	I do my best to look artsy, to fit in, but even though I am not wearing pearls, they
128080	134160	are still emblazoned on my chest.
134160	140320	And our instructor, Rhoda, introduces herself, and she says, there is no right way to make
140320	144040	art, and there is no wrong way to make art.
144040	149160	Now this makes me extremely nervous, because I have been raised that there is a right way
149160	153200	and a wrong way to do most everything.
153200	158840	And then she says, the class will focus on process, the process of art making, not the
158840	160920	end result.
160920	165640	Now this makes me even more nervous, because I have been raised to focus on results, and
165640	169880	not just any results, but the best results.
169920	173040	And there are no grades.
173040	177040	Things careen out of control.
177040	181280	If there are no grades, how will I know if I'm overachieving?
181280	185840	I need to know that I'm overachieving.
185840	190720	We start with the basics, and in my entire life, I have never held a stick of charcoal
190720	193200	in my hand, and it feels good.
193200	197920	And I survive the first week of simple art exercises, and I enjoy myself.
197960	202640	And the next week, Bob, one of the three instructors, says, today we're going to do gesture drawings,
202640	208320	very fast drawings, about 45 second poses, and we're going to draw the energy and the
208320	211280	movement and the essence of the figure.
211280	216240	And I am thinking, what the heck is essence, and how the heck do you draw it?
216240	219960	And a man, the artist's model, starts to undress.
219960	225200	And I say, well that's okay, you've seen a naked man before, you've even had sex with
225200	227560	a naked man before.
227560	236400	Your problem is, you don't know how to draw this naked man's essence.
236400	241360	And everybody else apparently does know how to draw his essence, as they're all busily
241360	246400	getting out their easels and knowingly getting out sheets of paper and charcoal and other
246400	249360	drawing mediums with which they excel.
249360	254720	And I'm just standing there like the proverbial deer in headlights, and I begin to watch and
254720	260840	imitate because I am clueless but competitive.
260840	266080	And so I ask Judy, who is standing next to me and also a mature student, I say, Judy,
266080	267920	what are these supposed to look like?
267920	271960	Because of course I think there's only one right way to do this, and we're all going
271960	273880	to draw the same image.
273880	280640	And she looks at me bewildered and says, they're all going to look different.
280640	283120	I'm paralyzed.
283160	285480	What is mine supposed to look like?
285480	290560	Can't I just do a slide presentation for your board of directors, maybe conduct a communications
290560	294080	audit, assess your customer service capabilities?
294080	299640	These are things I know how to do, things in which I excel, and I like to excel, and
299640	304920	there is no way I'm going to excel drawing this naked man's essence.
304920	309480	And I'm about to cry, and then the competitive side of me kicks in and says, well just snap
309480	311760	out of it, you big wimp, and do something.
311760	316320	So I start making these hopeless stick figures every 45 seconds, because that's how fast
316320	321960	the poses are every 45 seconds, and every 45 seconds I feel like a total failure, which
321960	329000	is a lot of times in one hour, it's 80.
329000	334920	And the shame is enormous, and I'm mortified at how inept I am, and I'm beating myself
334920	340760	up for ever trying anything different, for even attempting anything new, and I'm in literal
340760	346040	physical pain, I am so far out of my comfort level, I mean I actually hurt.
346040	352360	And I'm about to cry again, and that's when Bob comes over and shows me what amazing teachers
352360	358080	can do, I don't even know what he says, all I know is he talks me off the ledge and breaks
358080	362640	the vice grip that has a hold of me, and I start to draw.
362640	367560	At the end of class, Bob picks one of my gesture drawings to put up on the wall with a bunch
367560	371080	of other student drawings so we can discuss them.
371080	376400	No one laughs at me or my drawing, it actually holds its own.
376400	384440	I have drawn a naked man, and I feel like I can do anything, but things at home start
384440	386960	to get a little tricky.
386960	391760	My husband is an art director, one of the reasons why I married him, I loved being with
391760	395960	somebody artsy, he seemed so exotic and interesting.
396000	400000	He was the creative one, and I was the business one.
400000	404480	But when I started going to art school, all the roles were off, the balance of power completely
404480	406740	out of sync.
406740	411440	So class continues for the next six weeks, and it's an emotional rollercoaster, I mean
411440	415840	my thinking is shifting and breaking apart and I cry every day.
415840	420560	And my final assignment is a wall installation, which is a term I didn't even know existed
420560	422480	six weeks before.
422480	427320	And it includes these three wall sculptures, these sculptures made out of the New York
427320	432760	Times business sections and the Wall Street Journal, all painted black.
432760	435840	And they're bound in these really tight boxes.
435840	441560	And each piece gets progressively more undone until the final piece explodes.
441560	446640	And Bob, the instructor that talked to me off the ledge, sees it, and he says, Trisha,
446640	451720	you know, you really ought to apply to the museum school.
451720	455840	Well, this thought had never occurred to me before, I mean, in the back of my mind, I'm
455840	459800	going to end up in business school, that this is a once in a lifetime event until I go back
459800	466800	to my normal life, and I'm highly suspicious, and then it occurs to me what's happening.
466800	469600	He's hitting on me.
469600	473040	I have no artistic talent at all.
473040	476320	He's just flattering me until he can get lucky.
476320	480720	And this theory sticks until I find out he's been in a committed relationship for the past
480720	485520	18 years with his boyfriend.
485520	489560	So then I start thinking of other reasons why they may want me to apply.
489560	493620	Maybe they think I have a lot of money and I'll be a big donor, because I was working
493620	497560	at Harvard Business School at the time, or maybe they think I know people who will be
497560	498860	big donors.
498860	504640	And so while I'm using all of my creative energy trying to imagine why I'm not creative,
504960	509040	Charles, one of the instructors, comes up to me and says, Trisha, you really ought to
509040	510760	apply to the museum school.
510760	512600	I mean, you know you're an artist.
512600	514800	You're one of us.
514800	517480	Panic begins to set in.
517480	523080	And I enroll in art school as a part-time student, but I'm still consulting.
523080	529680	And I'm both excited and traumatized, because for the first time in my life, I am not following
529680	531680	the rules.
531720	539200	And I say to my dear friend Sarah, who's also a Southerner, I say, Sarah, I am so afraid
539200	542520	of being different than everybody else.
542520	549200	And she says, oh, Trisha, I'm so afraid of being just like everybody else.
549200	552320	And my marriage begins to explode.
552320	557720	And part of the reason is I'm not supposed to excel beyond men, definitely not beyond
557720	558720	my husband.
558760	563480	I had places I wanted to go, and he just wasn't moving fast enough.
563480	568000	I kept pushing him to move faster so I could move forward.
568000	574000	And one day, he just says to me, Trisha, you just want me to go places I don't want to
574000	576760	go.
576760	581760	At art school, since we don't have grades, we have review boards.
581760	585700	And at the end of each semester, we put up all the work we've done, and two instructors
585700	589540	and several students review the work, give us feedback, and guide us on our creative
589540	590780	path.
590780	595100	And I'm driving to my review board in the Jeep I've purchased for the yet-to-be-conceived
595100	597620	children I assume I'll have.
597620	600780	But instead, it's piled high with artwork.
600780	606940	And at my review board, one of the students writes this on his review board sheet.
606940	611220	You seem to be a little frantic.
611220	612220	Very perceptive.
612580	616020	It has something to do with control.
616020	618220	It's okay to let go.
618220	621980	You're expecting this to be black or white, but the process won't allow that.
621980	625100	You've got to let go.
625100	630380	I'm not sure if he's talking about my artwork or my marriage.
630380	635060	My husband and I separate, and a dear friend of mine says, you know, Trisha, I love my
635060	640700	husband and I love my children, but I never thought I had options.
640700	642780	You have options.
642780	648580	And she's right, because even though my life is blowing apart, or maybe because it is,
648580	652920	I begin to really find my voice and step into my artwork.
652920	658140	My mother sees it and says, why is it so dark?
658140	664860	Why aren't there any heads?
664860	670380	It's getting harder and harder to do my consulting work, and even though I'm getting paid a firehose
670380	675260	of cash, I know that if I do this work for much longer, I'm going to die.
675260	679060	Slowly, but I'm going to die.
679060	683060	And I realize I'm not just in the wrong job or the wrong marriage.
683060	685260	I'm in the wrong life.
685260	690020	I don't want to do what other people want me to do or think I should do anymore.
690020	692060	All I want is to make art.
692060	694460	I'm an artist.
694460	702900	And the week we separate, they tear down my family home of 25 years and my Jeep gets stolen.
702900	708580	I have this keychain with three keys on it, one to the house I don't live in anymore,
708580	714420	one to my family home that's been torn down, and one to my Jeep that's been stolen.
714420	718500	God is banging on my hood.
718500	723060	So I toss the keys, head to art school, and join my tribe.

00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
So a lot of people are raised with a religion, and I'm one of those people that was raised

00:08.880 --> 00:10.520
with two.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.160
There was our official religion.

00:12.160 --> 00:18.080
My family is, and I was at the time, conservative evangelical Christians.

00:18.080 --> 00:27.280
But then there was our unofficial faith and hope we had in Mary Kay cosmetics.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.680
Many of the women in my family had been Mary Kay beauty consultants since I was a child,

00:32.680 --> 00:40.520
and I loved Jesus as long as I could remember, but that Mary Kay thing, I was hoping to dodge

00:40.520 --> 00:42.800
that bullet.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.400
I was this brainy grunge girl from Boulder County.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.680
I wore hemp jewelry and clothes from the Salvation Army.

00:49.680 --> 00:55.760
I had moral objections to wearing makeup, and when I got a scholarship to go out of

00:55.760 --> 00:59.520
state for college, I thought I'd made my big escape.

00:59.520 --> 01:06.480
But my last visit home, I listened to one recruiting tape too many, and the logic and

01:06.480 --> 01:11.960
reason finally got to me, and I signed the dotted line, and I started my business as

01:11.960 --> 01:14.680
a Mary Kay beauty consultant.

01:14.680 --> 01:19.040
Now on paper, the business plan looks foolproof.

01:19.040 --> 01:23.240
All you're supposed to need is to have one friend to host a party for you, where you

01:23.240 --> 01:28.080
sell skin care and makeup to her friends, and then you're supposed to book two more

01:28.080 --> 01:31.760
every time, so your date book is never empty.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.000
But I could never book two more.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.520
I used the script I thought I was fun to be with.

01:38.520 --> 01:44.560
I don't know what the problem was, but luckily for me, there was like a hundred other ways

01:44.560 --> 01:49.800
they trained us to get bookings, and one of these ways was to strike up seemingly natural

01:49.800 --> 01:53.480
conversations with perfect strangers.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.000
And we had a name for this.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.800
We called this warm chatter.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.800
And I thought, damn it, I am going to rock this.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.280
I'm going to be the queen of warm chatter.

02:10.280 --> 02:15.720
So what I'm about to tell you, I did this for a very long time, about two or three days

02:15.720 --> 02:18.600
a week for two or three hours a day.

02:18.600 --> 02:23.000
I would get dressed up in my business suit, and I'd put on all my makeup, and I'd pack

02:23.000 --> 02:27.240
my bag full of samples, and I would drive to Target.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.480
And in Target, I would get my red shopping cart, and I would pretend I was shopping for

02:30.480 --> 02:37.360
items, but really, I was just hunting for women.

02:37.360 --> 02:42.180
I was looking for women who looked cute or friendly or approachable.

02:42.180 --> 02:50.100
When I found somebody like this, then I would just discreetly follow her through the store

02:50.100 --> 02:57.580
until we could be together in an aisle alone.

02:57.580 --> 03:06.420
And then I would appear to just be walking by normally, and I would slow down, and in

03:06.420 --> 03:11.140
the most casual way possible, I would say these words that I had rehearsed a hundred

03:11.140 --> 03:12.140
million times.

03:12.140 --> 03:17.420
I would say, excuse me, can I ask you a quick question?

03:17.420 --> 03:22.460
I'm Jen with Mary Kay, and we just came out with a new line of lip glosses, and I need

03:22.460 --> 03:24.020
some women's opinions of it.

03:24.020 --> 03:27.600
You know, I have some samples here in my bag.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.420
Is there any reason why you wouldn't want to take one home and try it?

03:31.420 --> 03:32.900
And this part was really important.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.740
We are trained to smile and nod while we ask the question.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.340
It has to do with the nonverbal communication.

03:38.340 --> 03:43.900
In mirroring, it's very advanced.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.780
And if she said yes, I'd give her the sample, I'd get her phone number.

03:46.780 --> 03:51.140
When I called her back later to thank her, I would offer her a complimentary appointment

03:51.140 --> 03:52.140
with me.

03:52.140 --> 03:54.980
And I wouldn't mention that all my appointments were complimentary, because it just didn't

03:54.980 --> 03:57.780
seem important.

03:57.780 --> 04:04.660
So at the same time I was doing this for my career, my husband and I were also helping

04:04.700 --> 04:07.420
to lead programs for our local church.

04:07.420 --> 04:10.180
And this was the kind of church that was trying to be really hip and modern.

04:10.180 --> 04:16.700
It met in a strip mall, and we had a rock band, a rock band leading worship up front.

04:16.700 --> 04:21.100
The pastor was this 40-somethings British guy, and he really wanted to attract 20-somethings,

04:21.100 --> 04:22.100
so we were a hot commodity.

04:22.100 --> 04:25.100
We were right in the demographic.

04:25.100 --> 04:29.780
And we started to get promoted up into higher and higher echelons of leadership.

04:29.780 --> 04:33.460
So we were invited to the leadership team meeting and then the core leadership team

04:33.460 --> 04:34.460
meeting.

04:35.260 --> 04:39.980
And I still remember my first night at one of these meetings, and I don't know exactly

04:39.980 --> 04:46.260
what I was expecting, but I think I'd always imagine them to be kind of soulful events.

04:46.260 --> 04:52.500
And I was really dismayed to show up and discover it was this really tedious conversation about

04:52.500 --> 04:58.340
branding and marketing and what the church's next advertising campaign was going to be.

04:58.340 --> 05:03.020
So it didn't take too long before these two worlds, the church and Mary Kay, started to

05:03.020 --> 05:08.420
look more and more similar.

05:08.420 --> 05:13.420
They both had the lure, and Mary Kay was giving out free samples, but at the church we were

05:13.420 --> 05:16.740
having free events to try and get people in the doors.

05:16.740 --> 05:22.140
In both worlds, we were couching everything we did inside a conversation about service.

05:22.140 --> 05:27.860
So Mary Kay's company tagline at the time was, changing women's lives, which if you

05:27.860 --> 05:34.820
think about it, isn't that different from saving people's souls?

05:34.820 --> 05:37.740
And we really believed it.

05:37.740 --> 05:42.420
We really thought we were doing this, even though nobody's motives are that pure.

05:42.420 --> 05:46.500
And in both worlds, I was being trained all the time to listen to people everywhere I

05:46.500 --> 05:51.300
went for whatever was missing or not working about their life and offer what we had as

05:51.300 --> 05:53.140
the solution.

05:53.140 --> 06:00.100
So if you needed time or money or flexibility, Mary Kay might be perfect for you, but if

06:00.100 --> 06:04.380
you're struggling with your marriage or you've had a recent loss, maybe you're questioning

06:04.380 --> 06:11.780
the meaning of life, call me crazy, but have you considered maybe Jesus is the answer?

06:11.780 --> 06:17.500
And soon I just started to feel like a 24-hour saleswoman, and it started to get confusing

06:18.260 --> 06:25.260
I was wearing at which time until one day I was in Target with my little red cart, and

06:26.380 --> 06:32.620
I saw this lovely-looking redhead who smiled so big when I smiled at her, and I started

06:32.620 --> 06:33.980
into my script.

06:33.980 --> 06:37.740
Excuse me, can I ask you a quick question?

06:37.740 --> 06:42.520
Except this time it starts to sound kind of flat, like those pull-string dolls that sound

06:42.520 --> 06:45.040
kind of wonky at the end.

06:45.080 --> 06:52.080
And suddenly I was just thinking, does she need Mary Kay or does she need Jesus?

06:54.600 --> 06:58.600
Does she need Mary Kay or does she need Jesus?

06:58.600 --> 07:07.600
And I don't know which one I offered her, but she said no, because I was acting crazy.

07:08.360 --> 07:15.360
And she turned and walked away, and I realized the problem with whenever you have something,

07:20.480 --> 07:25.360
whether it's a religion or a business or anything else that you think is the right answer for

07:25.360 --> 07:30.440
everybody, through that lens you can't help but look at everyone in the world as if they're

07:30.440 --> 07:36.280
broken and need to be fixed, and I didn't want to do that anymore.

07:36.280 --> 07:41.080
So I put my cart away at the front of the store and I drove home.

07:41.080 --> 07:47.800
The next night was my weekly success meeting, and the director was up front telling us,

07:47.800 --> 07:51.940
giving us all the information about the new lipstick formula and the changes that were

07:51.940 --> 07:55.360
being made, and I started to look around the room at these women, and they were either

07:55.360 --> 08:00.620
my friends who I recruited into it or my relatives who had recruited me into it, and I was thinking

08:00.620 --> 08:06.000
about how devastating it would be when I quit, because I wasn't just rejecting everything

08:06.000 --> 08:12.840
they stood for, but I was letting down my friends, I was bailing on them, and then my

08:12.840 --> 08:17.280
relatives, the people who had recruited me, their income depended on me.

08:17.280 --> 08:23.320
Their income, their status, all of our fortunes were tied in together.

08:23.320 --> 08:28.600
And I thought, but is this really changing women's lives the way I hoped it would?

08:28.600 --> 08:34.320
And the director started passing around mirrors and lipstick samples for us to try it ourselves,

08:34.320 --> 08:39.240
and I thought, no, I don't think so anymore.

08:39.240 --> 08:45.120
And a couple days later was the church leadership meeting, and the pastor was telling us that

08:45.120 --> 08:49.120
the church's new mission statement needed to have five points, one for every finger

08:49.120 --> 08:52.760
on the hand, so people could remember it.

08:52.760 --> 08:58.320
And I started looking around this room and thinking about what they would think about

08:58.320 --> 09:00.840
me when I quit.

09:00.840 --> 09:05.200
They would think I was backsliding and falling off the wagon, but it was even worse than

09:05.200 --> 09:06.200
that.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.680
They would think I was going to hell, that my children were going to hell, and if I was

09:09.680 --> 09:12.560
wrong, maybe they would be right.

09:12.560 --> 09:19.520
And I thought, but is this really saving people's souls, this, all this that we're doing?

09:19.520 --> 09:23.760
And the pastor interrupted to say that all five points needed to start with the same

09:23.760 --> 09:28.320
letter.

09:28.320 --> 09:36.880
And I thought, no, I don't think so anymore.

09:36.880 --> 09:44.080
And so that was when I stopped trying to save the world, and I decided to save myself instead

09:44.080 --> 09:47.160
from this life I didn't want anymore.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.920
And it really cost me.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.900
I lost my identity.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.760
I lost belonging.

09:54.800 --> 10:01.880
I lost the ability to ever be that certain or righteous about anything ever again.

10:01.880 --> 10:06.480
And if you can imagine what it's like to lose a faith, and then imagine what it's like to

10:06.480 --> 10:11.640
lose two at once, because even though Mary Kay was a business, it wasn't just that, it

10:11.640 --> 10:13.960
was a way I thought the world worked.

10:13.960 --> 10:18.520
It's a way I thought that we could all win and everybody could get what they needed.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.160
It was really devastating.

10:20.200 --> 10:25.120
I felt like I might not ever be able to trust myself again.

10:25.120 --> 10:30.320
The last piece of our exit strategy was our move to New York.

10:30.320 --> 10:35.480
We were going to get geographic distance, start fresh someplace else.

10:35.480 --> 10:39.720
We landed in Brooklyn in a neighborhood called Park Slope.

10:39.720 --> 10:46.400
And everywhere we went, people were either trying to recruit us into or warn us against

10:46.440 --> 10:48.840
joining the Park Slope food co-op.

10:54.000 --> 11:02.680
And it seemed so unobjectionable, you know?

11:02.680 --> 11:10.400
Like who can argue against cheap, organic, environmentally friendly food, community run?

11:10.400 --> 11:16.840
And part of me was really tempted, because I thought I can have my identity back.

11:16.840 --> 11:20.720
Everyone will know I'm a good person.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.960
And I can belong again.

11:22.960 --> 11:28.040
But there was something about the way that the people we talked to were just so convinced

11:28.040 --> 11:35.040
it was the right thing for everybody that felt creepily familiar.

11:35.080 --> 11:40.400
And I thought, I know where that path leads.

11:40.400 --> 11:46.960
So when one particularly zealous friend cornered me one day and said, are you going to join

11:46.960 --> 11:48.120
or not?

11:48.120 --> 11:51.080
Are you in or are you out?

11:51.080 --> 11:58.880
I just took a deep breath and I looked her in the eyes and I said, sorry, I don't do

11:58.880 --> 12:01.640
religions anymore.

12:01.640 --> 12:02.640
Thank you.

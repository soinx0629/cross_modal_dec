0	5700	grew up in a really small town in Alabama and my sister was and is to this day a
5700	11940	remarkably beautiful woman and I was always really good in school so it fell
11940	15140	into this pattern with my family where people would say things like she's the
15140	20580	beauty you're the brain and among my almost anorexically petite friends
20580	24820	growing up at five foot five a hundred and forty pounds it was universally
24820	29020	acknowledged that I was a fat one the whole thing really started in first
29020	33640	grade I have to say there was a weigh-in in school my best friend Ann Coley who
33640	36420	was going to go on to become the head cheerleader of our high school hopped on
36420	41460	the scale and weighed 45 pounds but when I jumped on the needle cropped it creeped
41460	46460	up to 50 and I looked over and I could see Nan looking at me in horror not just
46460	50140	for me but for herself and she suggested right then and there that go on a diet
50140	57220	and so I did for the next 20 years I would never wear a bathing suit without
57220	61020	putting a t-shirt over it first I would never change at a sleepover party
61020	64260	without getting in the sleeping bag I would never let a lover see me naked
64260	69020	with the lights on and not once did I ever stand in front of my closet to pick
69020	73340	out an outfit with any other intention other than to look as thin as possible
73340	78100	now along the way well-meaning people tried to help but just made things worse
78100	85380	such as my stepmother the Baywatch extra who decided when I was 11 yeah 11 years
85540	88940	old she said to give me a makeover but the result was something like if you put
88940	94100	blue eyeshadow and frosty pink lipstick on a cabbage patch kid it wasn't good
94100	99580	but somehow I managed to get through high school and college and at age 26 I
99580	106260	packed up my baggage and moved to Southern California where surprisingly I
106260	111980	actually got better there was something about like all the just extreme views
112020	116300	people had about their body all the fake everything and the bleach blonde hair
116300	121340	that made me kind of give up I think I kind of I think I kind of threw in the
121340	125460	towel and so I joined a gym down the street because it was cheap and I
125460	127940	discovered that lifting weights could be actually fun because you would get
127940	133220	strong and then with my newfound muscle tone I put on shorts for the first time
133220	136780	ever and went for a hike which led to a run and then when food was no longer the
136780	140940	enemy I started cooking healthy food and after six months I actually lost 20
140940	144420	pounds and one day I was getting dressed to go out and I actually glanced in the
144420	148740	mirror which of course I usually avoided and I realized I almost didn't recognize
148740	152820	myself and I examined myself from head to toe standing there in my bra and
152820	157500	panties and discovered that actually couldn't lose any more weight and I
157500	162220	actually looked pretty darn good now around the same time my boyfriend was
162220	165620	back in Boston and he had decided to produce an independent film and he was
165620	168860	begging me to come back east and produce the film for him but in order to do that
168900	172460	I calculated that I was gonna have to raise $2,000 over the next four months
172460	177900	somehow extra which my $11 an hour temp job really wasn't gonna produce so I
177900	181540	went out and got a copy of the LA Times and as I was perusing the ads for like
181540	185700	you know Chuck E. Cheese night manager and you know evening legal secretary
185700	193420	work I saw an ad that said dancers wanted earn up to $500 a night now you
193420	197380	have to understand I cannot dance I'm somewhat famous I'm my friends for
197380	200140	having tripped over my own feet when I was in college in Boston and actually
200140	205420	knocked myself unconscious on the sidewalk it's true so I ignored it and
205420	210180	went to the other ads but I kept coming back to it like $500 a night so I threw
210180	214180	you on the newspaper and I ran to my room and examined my butt carefully in
214180	218180	the mirror like could it be that my butt was good enough and I picked up the phone
218180	221940	and made an appointment with a woman named Samantha now my best friend Steve
221940	226020	was very against this he said Catherine your newfound self-esteem has been too
226020	230380	long coming and too hard one for you to risk it all because some bitch down at
230380	233220	the strip club doesn't think you're good enough and I knew he was right but I
233220	239820	somehow couldn't stop I just had to see so the next day I put on my sluttiest
239820	244700	outfit and made my hair huge and put on like all the makeup I owned and I went
244700	248600	down and as I walked into the club the most beautiful woman I've ever seen to
248600	254220	this day was pulling herself upside down naked up a pole with grace and I was
254220	258180	like what am I doing but just then I heard someone say you must be Renee now
258180	262900	Renee was a totally insane alcoholic legal secretary that worked with and I
262900	267500	was think I was hoping to channel her so I picked that as my fake name and I said
267500	270580	yes I'm Renee and I thought that there was gonna be all these questions and I
270580	274020	had memorized this detailed like personal history that was all a lie but
274020	279980	she just took one look at me and said when can you start so while I wanted it
279980	285580	in my head I was thinking like no way I was like how about Monday and she said
285580	289580	okay over the weekend I went out and bought a brand new pair of silver
289580	292980	panties and a silver push-up bra and these really amazing silver high heels
292980	297140	and Steve was still trying to talk me out of it he was like Catherine the
297140	300260	smarter the stripper the more they hate stripping what are you gonna do when
300260	303140	some asshole comes up to you and says hey you're pretty hot do you want to give
303140	306180	me a blowjob afterwards in the parking lot you're gonna want to tell him to
306180	309740	fuck off but what you're gonna have to do is go well I'll get fired if I do that
309740	313220	they'll be fantasizing about it the entire time you're on stage I'm on stage
313220	317500	and he said do you think you can do that and I was thinking you know for $500 a
317500	327020	night maybe I can so so so insanely that Monday morning I actually went to work
327020	330700	at my temp job and so at five o'clock I got off and showed up at the club
330700	333700	wearing my tipping outfit which was these very baggy awful black pants a
333700	338060	little sailor top my hair very straight and my glasses and as I walked in I was
338100	341460	told to go over and tell the DJ what my song would be and I walked around I was
341460	345740	like hi I'm the new girl I'll be dancing to Alanis Morissette and he was just
345740	349820	like all right and he says the dressing rooms over there and I looked at the
349820	354180	dressing room and suddenly I realized that behind that dressing room were
354180	359100	probably ten drop-dead gorgeous women and I was like oh my god and so I looked
359100	363380	at the door and I looked at the door of the club and just then I heard hi you
363380	367060	must be the new girl I'm Chloe and that turned into my right was this little
367060	370940	Patricia Arquette sort of knockoff girl and she was wearing stars on one boob
370940	374500	and spangled on the other and one of the 70s styles bikinis with a little silver
374500	379220	skirt and she was adorable she's like I'll show you the way so Chloe grabs me
379220	382780	by the hand drags me off and leads me into the dressing room and I start
382780	384940	getting dressed for the other girls and actually the other girls were pretty
384940	388220	nice and so they explained to me the rules of the club which I hadn't known
388220	392580	before in the first place the first song you did you know in your bra and panties
392580	395180	and little whatever you wore after but the set and they're like the only the
395180	399500	second song is topless and I was like the second song is topless I think I
399500	402060	think the whole time I've been pictured that would just go out on stage and
402060	406220	flip around and let the very end I dropped my bra and run but now you had
406220	409900	to be topless for an entire song and I'm like oh no but I was like okay and like
409900	412900	they're all looking at me I can't back out so like I'm taking off my clothes
412900	417140	and everybody's just naked and so just then I'm the DJ who was just what you
417140	422900	know 300 pound man named Rudy comes into the room and he says and he's like who
422900	435180	girls now the girls are kind of and I didn't even care and and I realized at
435180	438980	the time that maybe I'd gone somewhere that never been before mentally and
438980	443220	maybe I was gonna get through this night so Rudy leaves and I'm starting to go
443220	445660	to the girls go no you can't wear those silver panties you have to wear a G
445660	450540	string and I was like oh no I don't have a G string well bye bye bye but
450580	455340	Janae was this leggy blonde from Texas whose claim to fame was that she's
455340	460740	stripped into her six month of pregnancy Janae says hi I just washed mine here
460740	463620	you can borrow this and she throws it at me I'm like all right so I'm putting a
463620	469220	strange girls G string and I put it on and so the girls um helped me do my hair
469220	473460	and they make a huge and they put on my makeup and like fake eyelashes and all
473460	477220	this stuff and I was ready to go and as I walked out I glanced in the mirror and
477220	488260	I have to say that I looked unbelievable so so so I go out and I go back out to
488260	492100	Rudy and I'm like hi I'm ready for my song and he looks at me and he's like
492100	499980	holy shit box all that was under there and I was like thank you so then Chloe
499980	503900	starts giving me a tour of the club and as what she's doing this this guy comes
503900	509060	up to us on crutches he claims he even shot in a gang fight and he comes up to
509060	511820	me and he goes you're pretty hot you know I'll put you in a music video if
511820	516260	you'll give me a blowjob after the show and I'm like Steve you know and Chloe
516260	521560	says you grabs jumps back and screams fuck you she's a stripper not a goddamn
521560	528020	whore and I was just like nice nice so then I'm so then we walk back out and
528020	533460	and it's horribly the beautiful woman from like the audition day was out on
533500	536420	stage again and she was incredible dancer and she's running around and I'm
536420	540420	just like oh my god but so I couldn't tell Chloe I'm like you know I'm really
540420	543380	a little nervous and she goes no no no you'll have no problem she's like it's
543380	546420	not the best dancers that make all the money it's the girls you can really
546420	549500	connect with the men you can look from guy to guy to guy and make the guy think
549500	553180	that they're only looking at them and it's really not being about a dancer
553180	556060	they just want to see you nude up there but the biggest problem you're gonna
556060	560980	have is that you're gonna get bored no being bored was not something that
560980	565540	occurred to me as it was gonna be a problem she's like no you know you have
565540	568660	a special trick it's called the drop and roll so what you do you know as you go
568660	571620	out there and you sort of like slowly slowly slowly slowly lower and then
571620	574680	slowly slowly slowly roll around she's like the picture you rolling around in
574680	578100	their beds and then slowly slowly slowly slowly stand back up and if you do it
578100	583420	slow enough it could take up like two minutes and I was like great so I go out
583420	589780	and so then Chloe has to do her song and I go and I sit down near the door and I
589820	592540	get a coke to drink because I didn't want to drink alcohol because I had to
592540	596380	drive home like I'm such a nerd and so I sit there and I'm all of a sudden like
596380	599940	it was a really cold night and the wind blew in and I got really cold of course
599940	602900	I hadn't eaten for like three days because I was so nervous you know kind
602900	607060	of like today and so I was like I started to freak out and I looked up and
607060	610900	I was just like what am I doing and so I go over to Chloe who's come off stage
610900	615140	now and she's sitting next to mr. shot and the lead guy like they've made up
615140	619620	now they're friends again and so I go over and I'm like hi you know I was a
619620	623900	you have been so great and thank you so much but I just realized that I can't
623900	629540	dance so I'm gonna go home and practice and I'm gonna come back and Chloe looked
629540	634460	at me right in the eyes and she said if you walk out of that door right now you
634460	639300	will never come back and you'll regret it for the rest of your life and I knew
639300	644260	that she was right and just then mr. shot in the lead guy reaches out like
644260	648020	under the little dress somewhere and grabs my bare ass and he sort of
648020	651340	squeezes it and he slaps me in the ass and he says you know this is the worst
651340	654020	you feel this is the worst thing that's gonna happen to you all night and he
654020	658940	smacks me goes now get up on that stage and I was like all right
659820	665260	and so so I went out on stage and you know it's all went out and I walked over
665260	669140	there was a pole and so I sort of swung around the pole and like Chloe's running
669140	673020	around getting everyone to yell and scream as your very supportive friend and
673020	678180	so like I'm running around and I'm but and then all of a sudden insanely I run
678180	683300	out of things to do and I'm like the drop and roll so I'm like lower lower
683300	686940	lower lower lower lower roll roll roll and as I'm really right I feel something
686940	692420	hit my cheek and I'm like oh my god I'm so bad they're throwing napkins at me
692420	698620	and I turn my head to the right on stage and I opened my eyes and I saw that it
698620	704140	was a dollar bill and I was like and so then I'm like lean back like this and I
704140	708740	see standing above me is mr. shot in the you know gang fight man and he's standing
708740	713500	over me with a roll of ones pulling them off and dropping them down on top of me
713500	718620	and all I could think was I swear to God was what would my ophthalmologist
718620	723980	father back in Alabama think if he could see me right now so um but then like
723980	728860	everyone was throwing money and it was amazing and so I got up and then it came
728860	733100	to finally be the dreaded topless song so I went to the special topless part of
733100	739180	the stage and the song started and I unhooked my bra very slowly and slowly
739180	743060	the strap and slowly the strap and then I let the bra drop to the floor and I
743060	748540	stood there in front of a hundred and fifty people wearing only a g-string the
748540	753860	whole crowd went nuts and I have to say it was one of the most amazing moments
753860	768340	of my entire life no one in that club gave a shit when I made them at SAT no
768340	771420	one cared that was a straight student no one cared that was in the gifted class
771420	778980	when I was eight if they just wanted to see me nude it was so cool I never went
778980	785780	back to the club after that night in the first place security was pretty lax Chloe
785780	791780	kept making like little passing marks okay Chloe Chloe kept making remarks
791780	794660	about how only a few of her friends have been killed by customers which I found
794660	799780	disconcerting but the worst part was at the next day at work walking across the
799780	803260	Sony lot I suddenly was examining every strange man that passed me I was
803260	808140	noticing them and checking them out and I've always been one of the any seem
808140	811900	kind of yucky to me I was sort of it's like every man was suddenly a customer
811900	815060	and I've always known those women that really loves men and I thought if this
815060	817940	is where I'm like after three hours what am I gonna be like after three months or
817940	822180	three years but several good things came out of it in the first place one of the
822180	825060	customers taught me this really cool trick which is the guy is pawing you you
825060	828020	hold his hand because he thinks you're holding his hand but what you're doing
828020	833100	is you're holding his hand off of you this came in super handy the next
833100	841340	summer in my career as a film producer but the best thing of all is that to
841340	847300	this day anytime I'm having a fat day or I've just broken up with someone or I'm
847300	851220	just feeling a little down about myself all I have to do is open the door and
851220	855140	peek into the back of the closet where I still keep those silver high heels and I
855140	860740	know in my heart that everything is gonna be okay thank you

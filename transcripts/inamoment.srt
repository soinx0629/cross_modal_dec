1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,800
I love numbers.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,800
I love how straightforward and direct they are.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,660
I love how one plus one is always equals to two,

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,660
and how two plus two, without a doubt, equals to four.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,960
And so when it was time for us to decide

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,200
what we wanted to do in university,

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,360
I knew for sure that I wanted to work with numbers.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,320
So you can imagine my joy when I heard

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,420
about something called actuarial science.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,140
For those of you who do not know what that is,

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,080
it's this really amazing course

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,640
that has you spending your days doing things

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,720
like calculus and probability and statistics.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,000
It's what insurance companies use to know

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,960
the mortality rates, hence tell you

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,000
how much premium you need to pay.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,640
It's what governments use to know what areas to invest.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,440
I mean, who wouldn't want to spend

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,440
the rest of their lives doing that?

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,220
But just before I went to university,

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,040
I was diagnosed with epilepsy.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,200
And the doctor told me that I had to make sure

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,160
I did three things.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Ate well, slept well, and never missed my medication.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,440
So under the doctor's advice,

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,760
I enrolled to do actuarial science

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,960
at the University of Nairobi.

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,460
A few years into it, I was lucky enough

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,280
to get an internship at an insurance company.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,680
I remember my first day there.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,520
I had a mismatched suit, but it was a suit nevertheless.

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,480
And the director's assistant was assigned

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,040
to show me around.

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,360
And since we were almost the same age,

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,080
we quickly clicked and made it a routine

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,520
to come very early in the morning

37
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,060
just to share our dreams and ambitions.

38
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,200
A few weeks into the job,

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,660
the company got a really big business deal,

40
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,520
which meant all of us had to chip in.

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,960
And we spent one Friday afternoon

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,780
learning how to use this new fancy photocopying machine.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,560
On Saturday morning when reported for duty,

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,760
I got the honorable duty of working

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,060
with a new photocopying machine.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,960
I remember walking into the copier room

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,040
armed with a room of papers and a stack of files

48
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,160
that I needed to photocopy.

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,160
I opened the machine just to make sure

50
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,160
it had enough papers as we had been instructed

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,180
the day before.

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,360
Then I woke up in the hospital.

53
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,960
And the doctor told me that I have something called

54
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,900
photosensitive epilepsy.

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,040
This is a type that is triggered by flashing lights

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,920
and in my case, with the beam from the photocopying machine.

57
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,760
And since I had a known history of epilepsy,

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,080
the doctor said that there was no need for me to be admitted

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,240
and that I should go home and get some rest.

60
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,600
So I went home, got some rest,

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
and was looking forward to Monday morning

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,920
to redeem myself at the workplace.

63
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,000
On Monday morning, I went back to the office

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,680
and the director's assistant told me

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,220
that I had been given two weeks to get more rest.

66
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,860
I was really excited about this

67
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,300
because here I was doing my dream job

68
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,340
and I was working for a company that cared about my health.

69
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,660
And so I went home and I did some research

70
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,100
on this photosensitive epilepsy

71
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,860
so that I could make sure it never happens

72
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,940
in the workplace again.

73
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,420
And after the two weeks, I went back to work

74
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,800
and the director's assistant told me

75
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,400
that they'd given me two more weeks.

76
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,860
This time around, I wasn't as excited as I was before.

77
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,220
For some reason, deep within me,

78
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,940
this two plus two was not adding up to four.

79
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,020
And so in the evening, after work hours,

80
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,840
I called the director's assistant

81
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,580
and I asked her if she had heard anything about my case.

82
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,700
And after a few minutes of silence

83
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,140
in what was almost like a whisper,

84
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,360
she said to me,

85
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,620
Sitawa, the director said that

86
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,860
we cannot work with someone like you.

87
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,700
This meant that they couldn't work with someone

88
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,460
with a health condition like mine.

89
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,860
And after a few more moments of silence,

90
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,120
she said that he was thinking of telling the person

91
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,200
who'd introduced me to this insurance company

92
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,720
to break the news to me.

93
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,900
I can't really recall how that fun conversation ended.

94
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,120
I don't know if she hung up first or if I hung up first,

95
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,740
but I remember bursting out into tears.

96
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,440
And I cried because of the pain I felt

97
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,960
that the director of this insurance company

98
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,320
did not have the courage or the integrity to tell me

99
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,040
to my face that I didn't have a job anymore,

100
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,880
but he kept giving me two and two more weeks off.

101
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,360
But most of all, I cried because I didn't ask for this.

102
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,720
I just started falling down.

103
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
And so after a few days of crying,

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,960
I turned my tears into words

105
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,080
and moved those words to a blog.

106
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,520
And before I knew it,

107
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,080
people living with epilepsy were coming to my blog

108
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,760
for inspiration and information and support.

109
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,440
And as the numbers grew,

110
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
I started a hotline

111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,400
and they were able to get prompt support from it.

112
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,200
And so I started writing my own blog.

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I still love numbers.

114
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,200
I love the truth in them.

115
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,880
I love the fact that numbers tell us things about people.

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,920
And from the numbers I have interacted with,

117
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,600
I see a future where people like me living with epilepsy

118
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,760
increase in their workplace.

119
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,880
I also see a future where people working with us

120
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720
know that they can work with us

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,760
and they can touch us

122
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,800
and they'll not get this thing that we have.

123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,240
And this thing that we have

124
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,440
only puts us down for a little while

125
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,360
and after that we are able to rise up

126
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,680
to contribute to the wellbeing

127
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,080
of this amazing world that we live in.

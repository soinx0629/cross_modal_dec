00:00.000 --> 00:14.260
So, I'm not depressed now, but I was depressed for a long time and I wrote about being depressed

00:14.260 --> 00:23.460
and I lived for a long time with blinding depression and had long stretches when everything

00:23.460 --> 00:29.520
seemed hopeless and pointless, when returning calls from friends seemed like more than I

00:29.520 --> 00:36.200
could do, when getting up and going out into the world seemed painful, when I was completely

00:36.200 --> 00:42.720
crippled with anxiety and when I finally got better and started writing about the process

00:42.720 --> 00:47.760
of recovery, I became very interested in all of the different kinds of treatment that there

00:47.760 --> 00:53.060
were for depression and having started as a kind of medical conservative thinking that

00:53.060 --> 00:57.240
there were only a couple of things that worked, medication and certain talking therapies

00:57.240 --> 01:02.160
and that that was really it, I very gradually began to change my mind because I realized

01:02.160 --> 01:07.480
that if you have brain cancer and you decide that standing on your head and gargling for

01:07.480 --> 01:11.960
half an hour every day makes you feel better, it may make you feel better, but the likelihood

01:11.960 --> 01:16.360
is that you still have brain cancer and you're still going to die from it.

01:16.360 --> 01:20.200
But if you have depression and you say that standing on your head and gargling for half

01:20.200 --> 01:27.320
an hour makes you feel better, then you are actually cured because depression is an illness

01:27.320 --> 01:31.960
of how you feel and if you feel really great after you do that, then you're not depressed

01:31.960 --> 01:32.960
anymore.

01:32.960 --> 01:38.200
So I began to think all kinds of things could work and I researched everything ranging from

01:38.200 --> 01:45.640
experimental brain surgeries to hypnotic regimens of various kinds, I had people writing to

01:45.640 --> 01:49.840
me because I had been publishing on this subject, there was one woman who wrote to me and she

01:49.840 --> 01:55.160
said that she had tried actually electroshock treatments and a variety of other approaches

01:55.160 --> 02:00.720
to depression, medication and therapy and she had finally found the thing that worked

02:00.720 --> 02:05.520
for her and she wanted me to tell the world about it and that was making little things

02:05.520 --> 02:17.000
from yarn, some of which she sent me and none of which I'm wearing right now, but in any

02:17.080 --> 02:23.680
event I had that rich engagement and I also became interested as I was doing this work

02:23.680 --> 02:29.360
in the idea that depression existed not only in the civilized west as people tended to

02:29.360 --> 02:37.200
perceive it to exist but actually across cultures and had existed across time and so when one

02:37.200 --> 02:42.240
of my dearest friends, my friend David Hecht who was living for a little while in Senegal

02:42.440 --> 02:47.880
said to me, do you know about the tribal rituals that are used for the treatment of depression

02:47.880 --> 02:48.880
here?

02:48.880 --> 02:53.480
I said no, I don't know about them but I would like to know about them and he said well if

02:53.480 --> 02:58.560
you come for a visit we could try to do some research on this topic and so I set off for

02:58.560 --> 03:07.680
Senegal and I met David and I was introduced to David's then girlfriend, now ex-wife Ellen

03:08.240 --> 03:15.240
and it turned out that Ellen had a cousin whose mother was a friend of someone who went

03:15.240 --> 03:21.040
to school with the daughter of a person who actually practiced the ndop and that I could

03:21.040 --> 03:26.880
therefore go and interview this woman who had practiced the ndop and so we went off

03:26.880 --> 03:35.160
to a small town about two hours outside of Dakar and I was introduced to this extraordinary

03:35.520 --> 03:43.920
old large woman wrapped in miles and miles of African fabric printed with figures of

03:43.920 --> 03:49.120
eyes and she was Madame D'Youff and we did an interview for about an hour and she told

03:49.120 --> 03:55.040
me all about the ndop and at the end of it feeling rather daring I said, listen I said

03:55.040 --> 03:59.920
I hope, I don't know whether this is something you would even consider I said but would it

03:59.920 --> 04:07.480
be possible for me to attend an ndop and she said well I've certainly never had a foreigner the

04:07.480 --> 04:13.640
local word was to Bob I've never had a foreigner attend one of these before she said but actually

04:13.640 --> 04:18.640
she said I mean you've come through these friends and these connections she said yes the next time

04:18.640 --> 04:24.280
I perform an ndop you may be present and I said that's fantastic I said when are you next going

04:24.280 --> 04:31.920
to be doing an ndop and she said oh it'll be sometime in the next six months and I said six

04:31.920 --> 04:38.480
months is quite a long time for me to stay here in this town waiting for you to do one I said is

04:38.480 --> 04:45.480
there anyone who might maybe we could expedite one for somebody move it forward I'll pitch in

04:45.480 --> 04:53.080
she said no it really doesn't work that way she said I'm sorry but that's that's how it is and

04:53.560 --> 04:58.360
I said well I guess I won't be able to see an ndop then but even so this conversation has been

04:58.360 --> 05:06.040
so interesting and so helpful to me and and I I'm a little sad leaving here about not actually

05:06.040 --> 05:11.120
getting to see one but but I thank you and she's well I'm glad that you could come I'm glad it was

05:11.120 --> 05:17.240
helpful and she said but there is one other thing she said I I hope you don't mind my saying this

05:17.240 --> 05:25.480
and I said no what what is it and she said you don't look that great yourself she said are you

05:25.480 --> 05:32.240
you are suffering from depression and I said well yes I said I was very acute it's kind of a little

05:32.240 --> 05:37.960
better now but yeah I still do actually suffer from depression she said well I've certainly

05:37.960 --> 05:47.680
never done this for a tuba before but I could actually do an ndop for you and I said oh I said

05:47.680 --> 05:55.960
what an what an interesting idea I said well um yes sure yeah absolutely yes let's let's let's do

05:55.960 --> 06:02.080
that I said that I'll have an ndop and she said oh well that's great she said and she gave us some

06:02.960 --> 06:10.360
sort of fairly basic instructions and then we left and my translator the aforementioned then

06:10.360 --> 06:16.600
girlfriend now ex-wife of my friend turned to me and she said are you completely crazy do you have

06:16.600 --> 06:22.480
any idea what you're getting yourself into and I said well you know I'm all these things very

06:22.480 --> 06:27.480
interesting she said you're crazy she said you're totally crazy but I'll help you if you want so we

06:27.480 --> 06:32.120
had left and the first thing we had was a shopping list there had been a she had you could get them

06:32.120 --> 06:36.720
to buy the stuff but you had to pay a surcharge I'd said no we'd buy the stuff so we had to go

06:36.720 --> 06:46.240
out we had to buy seven yards of African fabric we had to get a calabash which was a large bowl

06:46.240 --> 06:53.880
fashioned from a gourd we had to get three kilos of millet we had to get sugar we had to get cola

06:54.040 --> 07:02.920
beans and then we had to get two live cockerels two roosters and a ram and so Ellen and I went

07:02.920 --> 07:07.640
to the market with David and with these other people and we got most of the things and I said

07:07.640 --> 07:14.000
well but what what about the the ram and Ellen said we can't buy the ram today what are we gonna

07:14.000 --> 07:23.840
do with it overnight so I saw the sense of that so the next day the next day we got into a taxi

07:23.840 --> 07:30.000
to go back out two hours to where we were going and I said what about the ram and Ellen said oh

07:30.000 --> 07:36.120
we'll see a ram along the way so we were going along and going along and there was a Senegalese

07:36.120 --> 07:41.880
shepherd by the side of the road with his flock and we stopped the cab and we got out and we

07:41.880 --> 07:48.960
bought the ram for seven dollars and then we had a little bit of a struggle getting the live ram

07:48.960 --> 07:57.280
into the trunk of the taxi cab so but the cab driver seemed not at all worried even by the fact

07:57.280 --> 08:04.280
that the ram kept relieving himself in the trunk of the taxi cab and so then we got to Rufi's can

08:04.280 --> 08:11.200
we got there so here I am I'm ready for my close-up and the thing about the end up is that it varies

08:11.200 --> 08:17.200
enormously depending on a whole variety of signals and symbols that come from above so we have to go

08:17.200 --> 08:22.960
through this whole shamanistic process and I still didn't know really very much of what was gonna

08:22.960 --> 08:29.200
happen so first I had to change out of my jeans my t-shirt and put on a loincloth and then I sat

08:29.200 --> 08:37.520
down and then I had my chest and my arms rubbed with millet and then which is a grain and then

08:37.520 --> 08:42.640
someone said oh we really should have music for this and I said oh great and I thought you know

08:42.640 --> 08:47.720
drumming I thought some atmospheric thing and she came out with her very prized possession which

08:47.720 --> 08:55.880
was a battery-operated tape player for which she had one tape which was chariots of fire so we

08:55.880 --> 09:02.920
started listening to chariots of fire and in the meanwhile I was given sort of various shamanistic

09:02.920 --> 09:07.320
objects I had to hold them with my hands and drop them I had to hold them with my feet and drop them

09:07.320 --> 09:11.920
I they would sort of say oh this augurs well this augurs badly there were five assistants to Madame

09:11.920 --> 09:15.960
Diouf who had all gathered around and we sort of spent the morning like this and it was all really

09:15.960 --> 09:23.680
just fine and then they said it was maybe we'd started at about 8 maybe about 11 11 30 they said

09:23.680 --> 09:29.880
well now it's actually time for the the central part of the ritual and I said oh okay and the

09:29.880 --> 09:34.200
sound of drumming began the drumming I'd been hoping for the drumming began and so there was

09:34.200 --> 09:40.720
all of this drumming and it was very exciting and we went to the central square of the village

09:40.760 --> 09:50.040
where there was a small makeshift wedding bed that I had to get into with the ram and I had been told

09:50.040 --> 09:55.360
it would be very very bad luck if the ram escaped and that I had to hold on to him and that the

09:55.360 --> 10:00.400
reason we had to be in this wedding bed was that all my depression and all my problems were caused

10:00.400 --> 10:05.400
by the fact that I had spirits in Senegal you have spirits that have all over you the way here you

10:05.400 --> 10:10.200
sort of have microbes some are good for you some are bad for you some are neutral anyway my bad

10:10.200 --> 10:16.840
spirits were extremely jealous of my real-life sexual partners some of whom are here tonight and

10:16.840 --> 10:26.480
and that we had to mollify the anger of the of the spirit so I had to get into this wedding

10:26.480 --> 10:31.600
bed with the ram and I had to hold the ram very tightly because he he was not having a good life

10:31.600 --> 10:38.800
this ram and he of course immediately relieved himself on my leg and the entire village had

10:38.800 --> 10:44.720
taken the day off from their work in the fields and were dancing around us in concentric circles

10:44.720 --> 10:50.160
and as they danced throwing blankets and sheets of cloth over us and so we were gradually being

10:50.160 --> 10:54.760
buried and it was unbelievably hot and it was completely stifling and there was the sound of

10:54.760 --> 10:58.960
these stamping feet as everyone danced around us and then these drums which were getting louder

10:58.960 --> 11:03.440
and louder and more ecstatic and more ecstatic and I was just about at the point at which I

11:03.440 --> 11:11.080
thought I was going to faint or pass out at that key moment suddenly all of the claws were pulled

11:11.080 --> 11:16.640
off I was yanked to my feet the loincloth that was all I was wearing was pulled from me the poor

11:16.640 --> 11:22.520
old Rams throat was slit as were the throats of the two cockerels and I was covered in the blood

11:22.520 --> 11:29.680
of the freshly slaughtered ram and the cockerels and so there I was naked totally covered in blood

11:29.720 --> 11:42.320
and they said okay that's the end of this part of it and I said well okay and they said but you they

11:42.320 --> 11:46.480
said we're actually we but there's the next piece comes now and I said okay and we went over back

11:46.480 --> 11:51.040
to the area where we've done the morning preparations and one of them said but look it's it's kind of

11:51.040 --> 11:56.440
lunchtime why don't we just take a break for a minute would you like a coke I don't drink

11:56.440 --> 12:00.760
coke that much but at that moment it seemed like a really really really good idea and I said yes

12:00.760 --> 12:06.560
and so I sat there naked and completely covered in animal blood with flies kind of gathering as

12:06.560 --> 12:11.480
they will when you're naked and covered in animal blood and I drank this coke and then when I had

12:11.480 --> 12:18.360
finished the coke they said okay now we have the sort of final parts of the ritual they said so

12:18.360 --> 12:23.160
first you have to put your your hands by your sides and and hold your stand very straight and

12:23.880 --> 12:30.400
I said okay and then they tied me up with the intestines of the ram and in the meanwhile it

12:30.400 --> 12:34.840
was hanging from a nearby tree and they were there were some instead of doing some butchering of it

12:34.840 --> 12:40.920
and they took various little bits of it out and then I had to kind of shuffle over all tied up in

12:40.920 --> 12:48.640
in intestines which most of you probably haven't done but it's hard I had to shuffle over and I

12:48.640 --> 12:55.320
had to take these little pieces of the ram and I had to dig holes and I had to put the pieces of

12:55.320 --> 13:01.000
the ram in the holes and I had to say something and what I had to say was actually to me incredibly

13:01.000 --> 13:08.720
strangely touching in the middle of this weird experience I had to say spirits leave me alone

13:08.720 --> 13:16.520
to complete the business of my life and know that I will never forget you and I thought what a kind

13:16.520 --> 13:22.800
thing to say to the evil spirits you're exercising that I'll never forget you and I haven't so anyway

13:22.800 --> 13:28.160
there were various other little bits and pieces that followed I was given a piece of paper in

13:28.160 --> 13:33.440
which all of the millet from the morning had been gathered I was told that the next morning I should

13:33.440 --> 13:37.560
sleep with it under my pillow and in the morning get up and give it to a beggar who had good

13:37.560 --> 13:42.760
hearing and no deformities and that when I gave it to him that would be the end of my troubles and

13:42.760 --> 13:49.560
then the women sort of all filled their mouths with water and began spitting water all over me

13:49.560 --> 13:55.120
which it turns out is the sort of you know it's the surround shower effect and rinsing the blood

13:55.120 --> 14:01.160
away from me and it gradually came off and when I was clean they gave me back my jeans and everyone

14:01.160 --> 14:12.400
danced and they barbecued the ram and we had this dinner and I felt so up I felt so up it had it had

14:12.400 --> 14:17.560
been quite an astonishing experience even though I didn't believe in the animus principles behind

14:17.560 --> 14:24.440
it all of these people had been gathered together cheering for me and it was very exhilarating and

14:24.440 --> 14:30.560
I had a very odd experience five years later when I was working on my current book and I was in

14:30.560 --> 14:35.560
Rwanda doing something else altogether and I got into a conversation with someone there and I

14:35.560 --> 14:40.320
described the experience I'd had in Senegal and he said oh you know we have something that's a

14:40.320 --> 14:45.120
little like that he said that's West Africa this is East Africa it's quite different but there are

14:45.120 --> 14:49.600
some similarities in some rituals here he said you know we had a lot of trouble with Western

14:49.600 --> 14:54.680
mental health workers who came here immediately after the genocide and we had to ask some of them

14:54.680 --> 15:01.920
to leave and I said what what was the problem and he said okay they came and their practice did not

15:01.920 --> 15:06.480
involve being outside in the Sun like what you're describing which is after all where you begin to

15:06.480 --> 15:11.480
feel better there was no music or drumming to get your blood flowing again when you're depressed

15:11.480 --> 15:16.800
and you're low and you need to have your blood flowing he said there was no sense that everyone

15:16.800 --> 15:21.960
had taken the day off so that the entire community could come together to try to lift you up and

15:21.960 --> 15:26.520
bring you back to joy he said there was no acknowledgement the depression as something

15:26.520 --> 15:32.480
invasive and external that could actually be cast out of you again he said instead they would take

15:32.480 --> 15:38.040
people one at a time into these dingy little rooms and have them sit around for an hour or

15:38.040 --> 15:48.800
so and talk about bad things that had happened to them he said we had to get them to leave the

15:48.800 --> 15:50.840
country thank you

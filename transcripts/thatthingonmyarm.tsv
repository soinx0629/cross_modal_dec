0	5000	People often ask me how I got the scar on my arm.
7000	13000	And what happened was, when I was 14 years old,
13000	21000	I got really sick and no one could figure out what was wrong with me.
21000	26000	I was very ill and finally, after a week of not getting better,
26000	33000	my mother took me to the hospital and I, after many tests,
33000	40000	was finally, days and days later, diagnosed with a hyper allergy,
40000	43000	something called Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
43000	47000	And once they finally found out what was wrong with me,
47000	54000	they treated me for it, but not before I had spent weeks in the hospital,
54000	60000	weeks blind and mute, as well as being fed by tubes
60000	67000	and having to sleep sitting up so that I wouldn't choke on my own saliva.
68000	76000	My mother, in her fashion, moved in to the hospital to be by my bedside
76000	82000	and slept every night in the hospital to take care of me
82000	85000	and she wouldn't leave my side.
85000	90000	And finally, when I was released on February 1st,
90000	97000	I remember it was a Friday, as we were riding home in our car,
97000	106000	she said, I've made a promise to God that if God delivers you safely
106000	110000	out of the hospital that I would go and I would do a penance
110000	115000	and I would go to the temple and make an offering to give thanks
115000	119000	for delivering my child home safely.
119000	124000	So I know you're really sick, but I'm going to see if your stepdad
124000	129000	can drive us on Sunday to the temple.
130000	134000	And I just sort of nodded in my very ill way and I said okay.
134000	140000	And on that Sunday, February 3rd, my stepfather and my mother and I
140000	148000	drove in our red Ford Mercury car with the black interior
148000	151000	to the Hindu temple and I was very ill.
151000	155000	I was very, very weak and frail.
155000	161000	And that was long enough ago, I was 14, a long time ago,
161000	166000	when they still had the front seat that was a couch seat.
166000	171000	So my mother wedged me in between her and my stepdad
171000	174000	because she wanted to take care of me.
174000	176000	I was still really sick.
176000	178000	I could barely hold my head up.
178000	181000	I had lost a lot of weight.
181000	185000	I was so weak that she said, you stay in the car, I'll do the offering.
185000	188000	She went, she did the prayers, she did the flowers, she rang the bell,
188000	191000	she got the food and they came back in the car
191000	196000	and she handed me this squeaky round styrofoam plate
196000	201000	with a bunch of yellow rice on it and some vegetable curry or whatever it was.
201000	205000	And off we went back down the highway
205000	209000	and I remember thinking what a beautiful sunny Sunday it was.
209000	213000	And I was trying desperately to concentrate on this plate of food
213000	217000	and my mother said, you know, just try and have a couple bites of it.
217000	221000	Just, you know, it's blessed, it's from the puja we did.
221000	230000	And as I was eating this rice, suddenly I heard a loud bang!
230000	235000	And I looked up and I can remember the plate flying
235000	241000	and yellow rice everywhere like confetti.
241000	245000	And as the rice came down, all I could see
245000	252000	was this beautiful blue sky, this crystal clear blue sky.
252000	259000	No clouds, no cars, no road in front of us,
259000	266000	no trees, nothing, just endless miraculous blue sky
266000	269000	and these kind of yellow grains flying all around.
270000	274000	Then all of a sudden I heard another thud
274000	277000	and then I kind of heard...
277000	284000	And it was us, we were flying and then we were airborne, I realized.
284000	288000	And then what stopped our fall was this tree
288000	292000	and then we kind of went down further down this embankment
292000	299000	and then finally came to a last thud
299000	302000	and there was just stillness.
304000	312000	I kind of strained my neck and I could see my mother to my right
312000	315000	and we were all pinned very closely together
315000	320000	and my mother had her eyes closed and her mouth open
320000	325000	and blood was trickling out of the side of her mouth.
325000	332000	And to my left, my stepfather was saying over and over again
332000	337000	this mantra of, where are we Vijay?
337000	341000	What happened Vijay? Weren't we driving Vijay?
341000	349000	We were at the temple Vijay, Vijay, Vijay, my mother.
349000	356000	And from my mother emanated this profound and nauseating silence.
356000	361000	And I started to scream at my mother.
361000	364000	I started to say, Mom, are you awake? Are you awake?
364000	367000	If you're awake, say something, say something, please.
367000	370000	If you're not awake, I love you, Mommy, I love you.
370000	374000	If you are awake, I love you, but please say something.
374000	377000	And in the back of me screaming was this chorus,
377000	381000	this non-stop loop of my stepfather,
381000	387000	almost like that cliche image or track that the cartoons
387000	391000	when a bird or a cartoon character is hit on the head
391000	393000	and they say, where am I? What's going on?
393000	395000	That was exactly what he was doing.
395000	397000	And he just kept repeating this.
397000	400000	And it was all of a sudden I started feeling things.
400000	405000	I started feeling hot and cold and wet and sticky and itchy
405000	412000	and burning and all I could feel from my mother
412000	416000	was this silence emanating from her
416000	423000	that kept getting louder and louder, this silence.
423000	427000	Then I finally heard a man call down to us and say,
427000	429000	are you okay? Are you okay?
429000	431000	I said, yes, we're alive, we're alive.
431000	433000	Please get help. Please, please get help.
433000	435000	And then a bunch of firemen came.
435000	438000	And I remember hearing the crunch of their boots
438000	443000	down the leaves, on the leaves, down the embankment.
443000	449000	And they came and they kind of got, I heard chainsaws.
449000	453000	I heard a helicopter in the distance approaching.
453000	455000	I heard blow torches.
455000	459000	I would later learn that they had to use these famous things
459000	462000	called the jaws of life to cut open the roof
462000	466000	of this red Ford Mercury Zephyr.
466000	471000	And so I got taken to the City of Angels
471000	477000	and my parents got taken somewhere else.
477000	480000	My arm, because we were pinned so tight,
480000	485000	my arm had flown across my mother's chest.
485000	490000	And so my arm was just shattered in many pieces.
490000	493000	And I lay there for hours and hours,
493000	497000	not knowing what happened to my parents,
497000	503000	not knowing if my parents were okay, if my mother was alive.
503000	506000	And I remember being incredibly uncomfortable
506000	512000	in a cold hospital bed with glass everywhere,
512000	516000	in every crevice of my body, under my nails, in my hair,
516000	519000	in my ears, just shattered glass everywhere.
519000	522000	And I remember, you know, in the emergency room,
522000	525000	I remember vague bits and pieces of what people said,
525000	529000	like, you know, well, I don't think it's worth doing,
529000	533000	but, you know, I questioned the mobility of that arm
533000	535000	or, well, let's leave it alone.
535000	538000	And we were home. It took us a long time to heal.
538000	541000	My stepfather broke his leg,
541000	544000	his left leg in four places, his hip in two.
544000	547000	My mother had to come home
547000	552000	and still have a hospital bed at home for weeks and months.
552000	554000	And we had one-to-one nursing,
554000	556000	24 hours around the clock at home,
556000	560000	because, of course, my mother this time could not care for me,
560000	562000	could not be by my side.
562000	564000	Indeed, she had her own hospital bed.
564000	566000	But my mother was determined.
566000	570000	They said that they weren't going to do any surgery on my arm
570000	573000	because they thought it wasn't really worth it,
573000	575000	that it would probably be dormant,
575000	578000	be kind of semi-lame at my side.
578000	580000	And, you know, I was so young,
580000	583000	I could learn to do everything with my left hand.
583000	588000	And so my mother was determined not to let this happen.
588000	592000	And so she, from her hospital bed at home,
592000	595000	ordered me to go to another orthopedist
595000	597000	whom she had found on the phone through colleagues,
597000	601000	and he said, well, she's so young, we should do it.
601000	604000	And he decided to do surgery on my arm,
604000	611000	and I got this very beautiful, thin scratch of a surgery incision,
611000	615000	and there was a cylindrical metal plate that was put on.
615000	621000	And as my arm got better, the scar got worse.
621000	625000	And, you know, I was very awkward to begin with,
625000	631000	and I was 14, I had all these hormones and feeling off about my body,
631000	637000	and I knew that the scar on my forearm was looking bad,
637000	640000	and so I knew what was to come with this scar.
640000	642000	And so, anyway, years go by,
642000	645000	and I had to have multiple surgeries on the arm
645000	648000	every time the arm got more and more better,
648000	655000	every time the scar got longer and thicker and ropier and darker.
655000	662000	And, you know, I kind of found ways to look normal while hiding it, you know.
662000	665000	And I would go on dates in college,
665000	667000	and I would have to really think about
667000	671000	whether I was going to wear a short-sleeve blouse or a long-sleeve blouse.
671000	677000	And then I was studying abroad, and I started modeling, of all things.
677000	679000	And, you know, I wasn't a fancy model.
679000	682000	I used it, I graduated from college,
682000	686000	and then I really started modeling to pay off my college loans.
686000	690000	I was a fit model, a workaday model.
690000	693000	And then this weird thing happened,
693000	695000	and the agency called me and they said,
695000	701000	guess what, Helmut Newton wants to shoot you.
701000	707000	And, you know, I was young, and I was like, who's Helmut Newton?
707000	710000	They said, you know, Helmut Newton, the guy, and he's great.
710000	715000	He does these beautiful, sexy, dangerous, edgy pictures of women,
715000	717000	and he wants to shoot you.
717000	720000	So, you know, before my agency would, you know,
720000	723000	when they were calling around, so they'd get comments like,
723000	728000	you know, yeah, she's kind of pretty, but that scar.
728000	731000	Those same people were calling, going,
731000	733000	can we book the girl with the scar?
733000	737000	It's amazing that somebody else, thinking you're cool,
737000	740000	can make you think differently of yourself.
740000	744000	And, you know, so all of a sudden I was doing all these runway shows,
744000	748000	you know, I was like doing Alberta Freddie and Herve Leger,
748000	752000	and all these great, and so my salary went up,
752000	755000	and, you know, all of a sudden I was the girl with the scar.
755000	760000	So, you know, maybe the scar was this mixed blessing in a way, right?
760000	763000	Because it paid off my college loans, and, you know,
763000	766000	bought me an apartment, paid off my mom's mortgage,
766000	770000	a lot of cool things, so I thought that was great.
770000	773000	And I was thinking about all of this recently
773000	779000	because I found myself on my back in another hospital bed
779000	783000	staring at another white ceiling.
783000	791000	And I was told that I would probably never have children naturally,
791000	797000	and that was very upsetting, as many women can understand, and men too.
797000	804000	And then I got pregnant, which was a real surprise, but a happy one.
804000	809000	And then I was told it would be a difficult pregnancy,
809000	811000	and then it was a really difficult pregnancy,
811000	817000	and I was ordered on complete bed rest the last trimester of my pregnancy.
817000	822000	And my mother, in true fashion, moved in with me the next day.
822000	824000	Yeah, it's true.
824000	826000	And, you know, when your mother moves in with you at 39,
826000	829000	it's a completely different experience.
829000	832000	But there she was, valiant in her nurturing,
832000	838000	and, you know, it was a very scary last few weeks of the pregnancy.
838000	844000	I wound up going to the hospital more than once before I had the baby,
844000	850000	and one time for five days with a fetal heart monitor and tubes everywhere
850000	854000	and staring at the ceiling and thinking to myself,
854000	857000	God, please get me out of here.
857000	866000	Please deliver me and my child intact and healthy out of this hospital.
866000	874000	I recently miraculously found myself again with my mother in another car,
874000	881000	this time going to Flushing Queens to another temple,
881000	888000	but this time to give thanks for the safety and delivery of my daughter.
888000	889000	Thank you.

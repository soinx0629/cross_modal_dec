00:00.000 --> 00:02.540
All right, thank you very much.

00:02.540 --> 00:04.540
All right, this is my story.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.560
I was dating this girl like two years ago.

00:08.560 --> 00:09.600
Been dating her for like eight months

00:09.600 --> 00:11.600
since she wanted to meet my parents.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.440
She was really giving me shit,

00:12.440 --> 00:14.240
like, how come I haven't met your parents?

00:16.240 --> 00:20.760
And, you know, I always just, I never liked,

00:20.760 --> 00:21.880
you know, I never brought anybody home

00:21.880 --> 00:23.720
to meet my parents, I was like 30 years old.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.160
Never met, brought anybody home.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.020
Never, I didn't ever like meeting people in general.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.600
God, I didn't want to meet her parents.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.440
I always hated when you had to meet,

00:33.440 --> 00:34.520
like, you know, go out with somebody,

00:34.520 --> 00:37.280
you gotta like meet their friends and shit.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.760
You know, sitting at the table trying to be interesting.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.280
I usually end up just sitting there staring at

00:42.280 --> 00:44.620
like mashed potatoes or some shit.

00:44.620 --> 00:46.680
So she's like, you know, how come, what's wrong with you?

00:46.680 --> 00:48.560
You know, how come you don't want to meet me, you know,

00:48.560 --> 00:50.560
bring you home to meet your parents?

00:50.560 --> 00:52.040
I started thinking about it, like, you know,

00:52.040 --> 00:54.600
not only had I never brought anybody home,

00:54.600 --> 00:56.580
you know, a girl home, and I was 30 years old,

00:56.580 --> 00:58.680
I'd never brought anybody home.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.200
Even like back in like first grade,

01:01.200 --> 01:02.760
like second grade, I may have friends and shit,

01:02.760 --> 01:04.920
I just never brought them home.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.160
So I started thinking like, you know,

01:07.160 --> 01:09.280
how the hell did that start?

01:09.280 --> 01:11.360
You know, as you know, so we're basically driving up

01:11.360 --> 01:14.440
from New York to go to my house to finally meet my parents.

01:14.440 --> 01:17.760
And I remember like, I think it was like

01:17.760 --> 01:20.000
when I was first grade, we used to have a bus stop,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.360
and it was like right out in front of my house,

01:21.360 --> 01:23.720
so my parents used to always be arguing.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.080
My dad was like a maniac, you know,

01:25.480 --> 01:29.920
God damn fucking bitch, you know, just total psycho.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.440
My dad was like a complete psychopath, you know,

01:32.440 --> 01:35.000
like his nickname in my house was called The Thing.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.040
Because that's what he was, he was like,

01:37.040 --> 01:40.360
he was this fucking thing that like, if he wasn't around,

01:40.360 --> 01:41.920
we'd say, dude, is The Thing home?

01:41.920 --> 01:44.320
You know, if he wasn't home, he could chill.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.800
He was just like never in a good mood.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.120
So one day I'm down at the bus stop,

01:47.120 --> 01:49.240
there's like, you know, 10 other kids down there and shit,

01:49.240 --> 01:51.380
we're all like in first grade, second grade,

01:51.380 --> 01:53.000
third grade waiting for the bus.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.200
And it's like towards the summertime,

01:54.200 --> 01:56.760
my parents got like the windows open and shit.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.120
So I can start to hear like an argument start,

01:59.120 --> 02:00.280
and I'm like, well, what the fuck do you mean,

02:00.280 --> 02:01.640
you didn't know?

02:01.640 --> 02:03.000
And I'm sitting there like, please,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.520
please let the bus come, please, for Christ's sake.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.080
And all of a sudden, you're a goddamn fucking bitch,

02:07.080 --> 02:08.480
yeah, screaming and shit.

02:09.480 --> 02:11.400
And I remember just looking at all the other kids' looks

02:11.400 --> 02:13.160
on their faces, like, I guess, you know,

02:13.160 --> 02:14.440
this is like way before cable,

02:14.440 --> 02:17.960
so most kids never even heard curses.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.080
They couldn't believe it.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.520
And I was just, that's when it really hit me,

02:21.520 --> 02:25.000
that man, my family's really screwed up.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.720
And I started going over other kids' houses

02:27.720 --> 02:30.540
and their parents seemed to get along, they were like, cool.

02:30.540 --> 02:33.960
And so the whole time I'm driving back,

02:33.960 --> 02:36.600
my girlfriend coming up, all this stuff is like coming back

02:36.600 --> 02:38.760
and I'm thinking, and I'm like really getting like,

02:38.760 --> 02:41.000
oh, like I'm a six-year-old kid again,

02:41.000 --> 02:44.280
like getting all nervous, like how my dad is gonna like act,

02:44.280 --> 02:48.400
because it's like embarrassing, you know?

02:48.440 --> 02:52.320
I mean, I remember like he was one of these dudes

02:52.320 --> 02:54.320
where like, I don't know, he's just always in a bad mood,

02:54.320 --> 02:56.480
like if he tried to like teach you something,

02:56.480 --> 02:59.640
he'd say it once, and then when you didn't get it,

02:59.640 --> 03:03.240
he'd just say it louder and louder.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.720
And I remember six, he's going, this guy, he's retarded.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.200
Like I remember we got a dog

03:08.200 --> 03:11.920
and he's trying to teach his dog how to sit, all right?

03:11.920 --> 03:13.520
It's a dog, it doesn't speak English,

03:13.520 --> 03:14.360
and he's sitting there going,

03:14.360 --> 03:17.980
and he's like, all right, sit, this little puppy, sit.

03:18.020 --> 03:21.340
Sit down, you're gonna get over there

03:21.340 --> 03:23.540
and you're gonna sit down.

03:23.540 --> 03:25.300
Dog's sitting there like walking around like peeing,

03:25.300 --> 03:27.500
like what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

03:28.900 --> 03:29.900
And that was like his thing, man,

03:29.900 --> 03:30.900
everything like in my house,

03:30.900 --> 03:33.660
my parents, they were like ridiculously strict.

03:33.660 --> 03:34.960
They had all these stupid rules,

03:34.960 --> 03:36.340
like I remember they had like this one rule,

03:36.340 --> 03:38.020
whatever you didn't eat for dinner,

03:38.020 --> 03:39.860
they would just like wrap it in cellophane

03:39.860 --> 03:42.580
and you had to like eat it the next morning for breakfast.

03:42.580 --> 03:44.340
And there's like, everybody's sitting there

03:44.340 --> 03:46.680
eating their like pancakes and waffles.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.880
You're like eating like cube steaks and shit.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.320
Dad be going, come on, eat it.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.160
I don't want to eat it.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.000
Eat it!

03:56.600 --> 03:58.520
So I'm like driving back and that's all I'm thinking,

03:58.520 --> 03:59.480
it's like, God, this guy's just gonna

03:59.480 --> 04:00.800
completely embarrass me.

04:01.560 --> 04:05.600
And I don't know, like it's just,

04:05.600 --> 04:07.480
I just felt weird, like my family was like,

04:07.480 --> 04:10.080
like the, you know, most famous like loving,

04:10.080 --> 04:12.200
like build somebody up, like our family was just,

04:12.200 --> 04:14.240
all of us just like ripping somebody down.

04:14.240 --> 04:18.840
Like, I think the worst thing he ever did to me,

04:18.840 --> 04:20.680
this is the one that really kind of made me like

04:20.680 --> 04:23.920
the anxious, like worrisome person that I am.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.240
I remember, it was right around Christmas.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.080
I was really thinking this,

04:28.080 --> 04:30.480
because I was driving this girl up for Christmas.

04:30.480 --> 04:34.040
He, he was giving me shit one day.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.760
He always hated when I was joking around.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.520
I think making my mother laugh somehow was,

04:37.520 --> 04:39.520
I don't know, bug him or whatever.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.480
So he kept giving me shit.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.920
Come on, man, you know, keep joking around, you know,

04:43.960 --> 04:46.360
giggling all the time, you're acting like a little girl.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.120
And I'm thinking like, cause he's always fucking with me,

04:49.120 --> 04:50.800
I'm going, God, here's a new angle.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.280
You know, you're asking for a football for Christmas,

04:53.280 --> 04:54.160
you're acting like a little girl,

04:54.160 --> 04:55.000
what the fuck's wrong with you?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.840
And I'm just sitting there going, geez.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.440
So like two weeks later, it's Christmas time,

04:58.440 --> 05:00.320
I got like four brothers, right?

05:00.320 --> 05:01.920
We always sneak down to go look at the presents.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.320
So we go downstairs, right?

05:04.360 --> 05:06.240
There's all these gifts down there all wrapped,

05:06.240 --> 05:08.440
we're all looking to see who got what, you know?

05:08.440 --> 05:10.800
There's all these little tags, to Ed from Santa.

05:11.600 --> 05:16.960
You know, be like, you know, to Bob from Mama Dad or whatever.

05:21.960 --> 05:22.960
And I'm sitting there.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.400
Just wait a second.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.320
So I look, in like the middle of the tree,

05:45.320 --> 05:46.600
I see there's a doll.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.000
And I'm thinking, I got four brothers,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
what the fuck is there, a doll sitting here?

05:53.400 --> 05:54.520
And I remember just looking at this thing,

05:54.520 --> 05:56.000
you ever see like those Spike Lee movies

05:56.000 --> 05:59.240
where like the background moves and the character doesn't?

05:59.240 --> 06:02.440
You just, it's like one of those deals.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.000
And I look up at this doll, right?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.240
And it says, to Bill from Santa.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.800
And I'm like, what the fuck?

06:11.920 --> 06:14.240
Guy got me a goddamn doll.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.200
He came downstairs and he's laughing and shit,

06:16.200 --> 06:17.240
and he's making me take a picture.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.440
I'm like six years old and crying and stuff.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.000
And I'm thinking of this shit,

06:23.000 --> 06:24.280
as I'm pulling into the driveway,

06:24.280 --> 06:25.120
I'm like freaking out,

06:25.120 --> 06:28.040
because I'm finally gonna bring somebody home

06:28.040 --> 06:29.760
to meet this fucking maniac.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.720
And I'm telling her, you know,

06:33.720 --> 06:35.440
I don't know how this guy's gonna be or whatever.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.000
So we're walking to the house, you know,

06:38.720 --> 06:42.360
it's like candles and shit, you know, Christmas tree,

06:42.360 --> 06:45.320
it's all real nice, dim lights and stuff.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.840
She comes in, she meets my dad,

06:47.840 --> 06:50.040
and the dude is like totally normal.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.600
After me building this guy up the whole ride back,

06:54.600 --> 06:56.720
he's like fucking like, you know,

06:56.720 --> 06:58.120
that dude from Leave It to Beaver.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.560
He's like the nicest guy ever.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.880
He's all cordial.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.840
And I remember I'm just getting like pissed at the guy.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.440
Go, why isn't he being a dick?

07:08.360 --> 07:09.960
And she's sitting there and taking me aside,

07:09.960 --> 07:11.440
going, he's the greatest guy.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.640
I can't believe you're saying all that stuff.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.400
He's such, you know, he's smart, he's intelligent,

07:15.400 --> 07:18.360
he's so interested in what I have to say.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.920
I remember I was like, I was so pissed at the guy.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.920
I mean, I really hated him when I was growing up.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.200
To the point, I remember one time he went out on the driveway

07:27.200 --> 07:28.880
and he's running out to his car,

07:28.880 --> 07:31.920
and he slipped and fell and broke his shoulder.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.840
And at that point, me and my brother

07:32.840 --> 07:34.080
so fucking hated this guy.

07:34.080 --> 07:34.920
When he came to the house,

07:34.920 --> 07:36.400
my mother's like taking care of him.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.800
We snuck out the back door

07:37.800 --> 07:40.120
to look at his footprints in the snow

07:40.120 --> 07:41.480
to see where he slipped and fell.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.800
And I'm telling you, we were laughing our asses off

07:43.800 --> 07:44.640
at this guy.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.800
You're right there, right there, that's my brother.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.600
Fuck, why couldn't I have seen that?

07:52.000 --> 07:52.840
So,

07:55.320 --> 07:57.040
so he ended up being like the sweetest guy ever

07:57.040 --> 07:58.560
and there was nothing anxious about it.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.600
I like worried about it for like,

08:00.600 --> 08:01.560
I don't know, from the beginning of the time,

08:01.560 --> 08:02.760
dating girls was like 15

08:02.760 --> 08:05.360
and I just ended up feeling really stupid.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.320
And I was kind of pissed.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.160
I was just looking at the guy going,

08:09.160 --> 08:12.280
oh, why the fuck couldn't you have been like this

08:12.280 --> 08:14.520
20 years ago when I needed him to be like that

08:15.760 --> 08:20.400
rather than being the way he was?

08:21.760 --> 08:23.520
And that's my story, thanks.

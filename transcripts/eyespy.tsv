0	5760	I grew up in Providence, Rhode Island, and for my entire childhood, we were never more
5760	12800	than 20 miles away from the core of our universe, the Kennedys.
12800	14800	We were Irish, they were Irish.
14800	16840	We were Catholic, they were Catholic.
16840	18680	They were family.
18680	22360	We were like the relatives that they never got to see.
22360	27360	But we knew, you know, they're busy, and we knew that they loved us.
27360	30980	So anything that was happening to them was also happening to us.
30980	36760	So their tragedy, plus our own tragedy, was a lot.
36760	41360	So this one Thanksgiving after dinner and a family fight at Grandma's house, we were
41360	42800	in the car and we're driving home.
42800	47600	And the radio was playing this 10th anniversary of the JFK assassination.
47600	50820	And I'm sitting in the back seat, and I start to cry.
50820	54800	And my sister Erin says, hey, Dad, Michaela's crying.
54800	58220	And my father pulls that car right over to the shoulder of I-95.
58220	61240	He stops it, he turns around, and he looks at us.
61240	72000	And with tears in his own eyes, he says, don't you ever be ashamed to cry for that man.
72000	77320	So my parents grew up near Newport, and they got married in the same exact church as Jack
77320	79380	and Jackie, St. Mary's.
79420	86380	And my father gave exact replica jewelry to my mother that was replications of the jewelry
86380	88700	that Jack gave to Jackie.
88700	92920	And every Saturday night after mass, my family would be in the living room and we'd be happily
92920	98440	ever aftering to the original soundtrack of Camelot.
98440	103700	And every year during the 70s, my four aunts would take me and my two cousins on their
103700	111620	dream vacation, a rented beach house in Hyannis on the very cove sharing beachfront with the
111620	114280	Kennedy compound.
114280	118700	Every day for an entire week, my Aunt Pat would roll up her sister's hair.
118700	123500	My aunts would apply sunscreen to the back of their necks, the backs of the hands, and
123500	125100	the tops of their feet.
125100	128920	And then they would drag their beach chairs down to the beach, and they would set them
128920	138200	up perfectly, not facing the water, not into the sun for tanning, but perfectly for spying
138200	140440	on the Kennedys.
140440	145000	They would sit there all day in the broiling sun with high-powered binoculars and keep
145000	147480	a constant surveillance.
147480	151000	And every year they'd have the same exact conversations.
151000	155320	Usually around mid-morning, the first sighting would be made, usually by my Aunt Pat.
155320	168280	She'd be, up, they got Rose out, walking, Ethel looks drawn.
168280	172020	And then about an hour later, my Aunt Gert would say, how old is Rose now?
172020	173880	And Aunt Momo would make the calculations.
173880	175200	Well, let's see.
175200	181640	Jack died in 63 when she was 74, and Rose's birthday was two weeks last Thursday, and
181800	187040	Joe died in 69, making her a widow at 81, so 85.
187040	190880	And then they'd break for lunch.
190880	196480	So after lobster and drawn butter and hosing us down, they'd all hustle back to their posts,
196480	197480	and they'd watch.
197480	199520	And every now and then, there'd be something they didn't know.
199520	200520	Hey, who's that?
200520	201520	Who's that?
201520	202520	Who's that?
202520	205600	So they'd draw out the family tree in the sand, they'd analyze it, they'd come up with
205600	207800	a profile, and they'd crack the code.
207800	210840	It's one of Bobby's.
210840	216840	Now any mention of Bobby would always bring up the inevitable, oh, I just pray to God
216840	222560	they don't tell poor senile Rose about Bobby, it'll break her.
222560	227720	So then the long afternoon stretch would end with the inevitable annual observation, you
227720	230420	don't see Jackie much here.
230420	235880	And then all of my aunts would drop their binoculars and look at each other meaningfully.
235880	239320	Now all of this meant that no one was paying any attention to me and my cousins in the
239320	241440	water.
241440	244400	And the summer when we were nine years old, we found something.
244400	250800	Now had an aunt, perhaps in an effort to ease a cramp in her prying neck, just sort of glanced
250800	252060	towards the water.
252060	258740	She might have seen us climbing into this tiny plastic half inflated boat.
258740	263720	She might have cried out an alarm at the lack of oars and life vests.
263720	268640	She might have had a conniption fit to see us shove off and drift into the violent rip
268640	273520	tide that would sweep us within five minutes out to the open sea and the Nantucket bound
273520	277400	ferry.
277400	281280	But an aunt didn't, and we did.
281280	285440	It all happened so fast that we were swept out, and it wasn't until we realized that
285440	290060	we could make out the specific features of the ferry passengers that we were really
290060	291920	far from shore.
291920	297120	We were so far from shore that my aunts were now reduced to four hopping dots.
297120	301080	Uh oh, it was like Gilligan's Island for real.
301080	305680	So an Atlantic swell crashes over our heads, and as soon as the water clears out of our
305680	309720	eyes, a powerboat pulls up out of nowhere.
309720	316040	And in this powerboat are David and Michael Kennedy.
316040	321640	So David and Michael pull us up into the boat, and we are like, oh my God, we are saved by
321640	326680	a powerboat.
326680	331560	So the powerboat sends us back to shore, and we're psyched because we're saved until we
331560	338160	start to watch the four hopping dots morph back into our four crazed, livid aunts.
338160	340560	We are so going to get it.
340560	343640	Now my family under any circumstances has this really weird thing, well they each have
343640	347840	like their own weird thing, about like yelling and getting into huge trouble.
347840	353640	Like my aunt Gur, like she gets so freaked out that all she can do is yell out our addresses.
353640	358800	Like Eileen and Kevin, 275 Hooper Street.
358800	361560	Michaela, 180 Asylum Road.
361560	364120	I swear to God, I grew up on Asylum Road.
364120	367640	It's a very telling piece of my childhood.
367640	371880	And then my aunt Pat would do these things where she would say these things that were
371880	376400	like actually kind of nice things, but she'd say them like they were death threats.
376400	378560	She'd be like, yeah, I'll save you from drowning.
378560	383160	You get on that beach towel and you lie in that sun, now.
383160	385520	Or she'd say, I'm going to buy you a birthday present.
385520	388360	You eat that cake, now.
388360	389880	So we knew that this is what was coming.
389880	391360	The Kennedy boys didn't.
391360	395880	So they're vivaciously tanned and they pull up to the shoreline and we brace ourselves.
395880	398560	Now what happens is our aunts are out of their minds.
398560	400560	They're ready to flay us.
400560	405960	But when they see us in the same boat as the Kennedys, it's like they don't have the
405960	410040	emotional capacity to handle it.
410040	412160	They kind of snap.
412160	415800	They're kind of like freaking out to yell at us, but they start fake smiling and trying
415800	417840	to act all normal.
417840	422600	And my aunt Momo, she takes on this Kennedy-esque way of speaking, which is sort of halfway
422600	426280	between Katharine Hepburn and the Queen of England.
426280	428640	And we're looking at them like, what are you guys doing?
428640	432880	And they're smiling to smile, but when they smile at us, it's like, you just wait.
432880	435880	But they're like, oh, David, oh, Michael, thank you, thank you, thank you.
435880	439480	And they're not mad at us for almost drowning.
439480	442960	They're mad at us because the Kennedys had to save us.
442960	447000	Like don't those people have enough trouble?
447000	449400	Now you?
449400	453960	Like as if our almost drowning was yet another Kennedy tragedy.
453960	457320	So these poor boys finally pull and pry themselves away from my aunts.
457320	461400	They get back on the boat and they're leaving and my aunt Momo's going, please give our
461400	465000	best to your grandmother.
465000	470280	And now it's time for our for real punishment, which was that we for the rest of vacation
470280	475400	had to stay on the beach because we did not have any respect for the water.
475400	477520	So it's a hundred degrees out.
477520	483240	And after about a half hour of whining and fighting and like emptying out all the copper
483240	488560	tone and kicking sand, we break my aunt Pat's last nerve and she says, all right, you can
488560	491400	go in the water, but only up to your knees.
491400	494880	So we're happy for a minute until we get in the water and realize how boring up to
494880	496320	your knees is.
496320	499480	And then we get the great plan of having chicken fights.
499480	502920	So we start to have chicken fights, but it's kind of weird because there's only three of
502920	503920	us.
503920	507500	So, but we're doing the best we can to have a chicken fight like that and like knock each
507500	510240	other off into the water so we get fully immersed.
510240	516580	And then my uncle Al, who never ever played with us ever comes into the water to play
516580	520800	chicken fights with us and he puts his daughter, my cousin Eileen up on his shoulders.
520800	524240	And then I get up on my cousin Kevin's shoulders and we're having chicken fights and it's like
524240	526160	actual family fun for a moment.
526160	529100	And we're like, you know, hitting each other, falling in the water.
529100	536560	And then I take my foot and I accidentally kick the side of my uncle Al's head really,
536560	549840	really hard and his eyeball pops out of his head, falls into the water and sinks.
549880	554960	It pops out of his head and it sinks.
554960	560160	Eileen, Kevin and I are in instant complete shock.
560160	564680	Right this minute there is still a part of me that is on that beach screaming.
564680	571120	It's like, oh my God, we had no idea that he had a fake eye.
571120	572840	We didn't even know that you could have a fake eye.
572840	575040	Why would you have a fake eye?
575040	577920	They didn't tell us that you, that uncle Al had a fake eye because they didn't want his
578000	580280	blabbing it to the whole neighborhood.
580280	581280	So they didn't tell us.
581280	582280	So we didn't know.
582280	586680	And like later on, you know, there was Columbo and Sandy Duncan, but this was way before that.
586680	588920	We had no idea.
588920	591560	So we're all standing there and it's like so horrible.
591560	594080	Like I can't even like, I'm like, oh my God.
594080	598060	And, and my cousins Eileen and Kevin are staring at me with complete hate.
598060	601440	Like you broke our dad.
601440	607280	And my uncle Al is standing there and he's got the lid open so you can like see inside
607280	612040	the socket where now it's just like skin and the eyeball gone.
612040	617640	And like, you cannot just say I'm sorry to someone that you just, so I don't know what
617640	618640	to do.
618640	624620	And my aunt Pat is hysterically screaming because that eyeball cost top dollar.
624620	628720	It was a special magnetized eye so it could keep up with the other one.
628720	633480	And now I had just been to pray that vacation was over and that they got that deposit back
633480	636640	because now they were going to have to buy a brand new top dollar eye that was not in
636640	638200	the budget.
638200	639400	So I just didn't know what to do.
639400	641360	I was like, my life is over.
641360	643220	I am no longer Michaela.
643220	647400	I am now Murph's girl who kicked Al's eye out in the cape.
647400	651060	And it's awful and everybody's just crying and pointing at me and now my other aunts
651060	654720	are getting in on it like and who's the blame part of the conversations happening.
654720	657200	So I just kind of back off into the water.
657200	661760	I'm kind of like going back and like regressing back to like where life as I once knew it
661760	662760	had ended.
662760	666600	And I just stand there and like, I kind of wish I had drowned and I kind of wish
666600	668680	the Kennedys hadn't saved me.
668680	673120	And I bent off into the waves and I just, I just started like sifting through sand and
673120	677040	shells and pebbles and it's totally ridiculous but like I will never stop looking for this
677040	678040	eye.
678040	679040	I'm going to look forever.
679040	681960	And I keep looking and looking and I'm sifting through and then all of a sudden there is
681960	685720	an eyeball in my palm staring right at me.
685720	691520	And so I scream and I drop it back and it sinks back into the water.
691520	693160	But now we know it's possible.
693160	697320	So everybody gets back into the water and now we're all sifting through and sifting
697320	702760	through and I pray to God for no more future happiness until we find this eye.
702760	707080	And I also kind of pray that it not be me that finds it this time.
707080	711400	So after like an hour my cousin Kevin finds the eye and he holds it up in triumph and
711400	712400	he does not let go.
712400	719260	And my uncle Al takes the eye, he like washes it off and just pops it back in.
719260	722480	And then he kind of like tests it, you know, and it's like keeping up with the other one.
722480	725120	So it's working still.
725120	728080	And now it's the weirdest thing because now we know it's a fake eye.
728080	730720	And now that you know it's a fake eye, it totally looks like a fake eye.
730720	734280	And I can't believe that I never noticed it wasn't a fake eye before.
734280	736760	So now vacation's back on.
736760	740380	And so everybody gets back into their beach chairs and they start to settle down to begin
740380	744920	telling the story over and over like a million times about what I just did.
744920	749420	And I have not really fully reintegrated back into the family yet.
749420	750600	I'm kind of standing apart.
750840	753560	And I notice that there actually has been like kind of a group of people who've been
753560	755360	watching this whole thing.
755360	759400	And then I see something that I didn't notice that no one noticed.
759400	764840	And that's that two of the Kennedy kids, David and Michael, had taken a walk on the beach.
764840	771280	And I can tell just by the look on their faces that they had stood there and seen the entire
771280	779080	episode, that they had been there watching us.
779080	779320	Thank you.

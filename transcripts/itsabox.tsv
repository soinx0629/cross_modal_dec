0	9000	Felly rydw i'n ymwneud yn y botwm ffon ac rydw i'n rhoi £0.20 yn ymwneud ac rydw i'n ffon fy ffrind, ac mae'n cymryd.
9000	12000	Felly rydw i'n rhoi £0.50 yn ymwneud.
12000	15000	Ac roedden ni'n mynd i ddweud.
15000	19000	Rydw i'n teimlo'r ddau yn ôl i mi.
19000	22000	Rydw i'n mynd i ddweud.
22000	27000	Rydw i'n mynd i ddweud.
27000	35000	Rydw i'n teimlo'r ddau yn ôl i'r botwm ffon ac rydw i'n gweld ychwanegu'r ddau.
39000	43000	Yn ystod y tu allan, roeddwn i'n byw ar y fflat fy ffrind.
43000	47000	Roedd hi'n byw ar y camys Unedig yn y Cynulliad Cymru.
47000	51000	Roedd hi'n byw ar gyfer gwaith ac roedd hi wedi rhoi'r llwybr i'n fflat,
52000	56000	allwn i'n byw ar y camys Unedig,
56000	59000	unrhyw lle yn Hansworth Ward,
59000	64000	ond pan oeddwn i'n byw ar y fflat yn y Llyfrgell,
64000	69000	roeddwn i'n dechrau bod yn sianol i'n mynd i'n mynd i hefyd.
69000	73000	Roeddwn i'n byw ym mhob.
73000	76000	Roeddwn i'n byw ym mhob, roeddwn i'n byw yn y ddau,
76000	79000	ac roeddwn i'n byw ar fy mhob.
79000	82980	Oherwydd o'r hyn, roedd y ffordd yn fy holl ddweud,
82980	85920	dweud dweud dweud,
85920	88600	ond rwy'n gwybod i dweud.
88600	90920	Ac un o'r ffordd, roedd y ffordd dweud dweud,
90920	93600	dweud dweud dweud.
93600	94720	Now to tell you the truth,
94720	97920	I wasn't really sure what to make of this voice.
97920	99520	It made me quite anxious,
99520	101520	but I couldn't quite figure out what it meant
101520	103780	or what could possibly happen.
103780	107040	And I had to think about it for a while.
107040	108880	And eventually I decided,
108880	111640	no, I'm going to go home.
111640	114800	But to appease this voice in my head,
114800	118560	I decided to remove my jewellery, my watch,
118560	120280	leave my cards behind and my cash,
120280	123360	but just take enough money for my bus fare there
123360	125360	and to return the following morning
125360	127080	and enough also to phone my boyfriend
127080	129640	from the payphone on campus.
129640	131440	And so I set off.
131440	133640	And it was probably about, I don't know,
133640	136600	8.30 in the evening.
136600	138280	So I was studying in Birmingham
138280	141320	and their subways, particularly when I was there,
141320	144640	had a reputation for being quite seedy and unsafe.
144640	146040	And I had actually been flashed at
146040	148760	a number of times down there.
148760	150440	But on this particular occasion,
150440	152200	as I walked through the tunnel,
152200	155520	I noticed a female police officer ahead of me.
155520	159240	And I remember thinking this was a good omen.
159240	160560	I kind of broke my stride
160560	163440	so we were almost walking in tandem
163440	165200	without making it too obvious.
165200	166960	And then I exit the subway
166960	169240	and I get to my bus stop.
169240	172600	And usually, regardless of what the timetable says,
172600	175720	I always have to wait half an hour for my bus.
175720	177960	But on this particular evening,
177960	179600	it comes within minutes.
181000	182240	So when I get on the bus,
182240	183840	I actually sit near the bus driver
183840	186560	because I think this is the most sensible thing to do.
187720	189520	And then I arrive at my stop.
190720	192160	And at this point, I'd say,
192160	194800	I'm pretty much on the home stretch.
196040	198440	All I have to do now is get home.
198440	200520	And as I'm walking along the street,
200520	204200	I suddenly notice an empty phone box on the corner.
204200	206200	And in that moment, I decide,
206200	208800	I'm going to call my boyfriend from there.
208800	210160	Now, I make this decision
210160	213640	because the payphone on my campus serves about 50 people
213640	215600	and it's always ringing off the hook.
215600	217760	So if I really want to speak to my boyfriend tonight,
217760	220480	this is my best chance.
220480	222720	I realise at this point,
222720	224800	I'm slightly deviating from the plan
224800	226960	of just going straight home.
226960	228880	But I can distinctly remember
228880	231280	as I felt the door close behind me.
232840	234840	I'm safe in here.
234840	236960	It's a box.
236960	241880	So I put my money in and I call my boyfriend.
241880	245720	And then suddenly, I feel the door behind me open.
247280	249400	A hand appears out of nowhere
249400	252480	and I watch it press down the switch hook of the phone.
253920	256000	I hear the pound coin drop to the bottom
256000	259000	and I watch this hand remove the coin.
262240	264280	I don't remember dropping the receiver,
265240	269320	but I do remember seeing it swing from side to side.
269320	272440	Suddenly, these arms tighten around me
272440	275560	and I can feel something sharp against my neck.
276760	278080	And I'm scared.
278880	281000	I'm so scared.
281000	284440	My mouth is dry and I can hardly breathe
284440	287440	and my heart is beating so fast,
287440	289760	I can feel it pulsing in the back of my throat
289760	292240	like at any moment it could just rip through.
293200	296680	And I'm fighting so hard to stop my knees from buckling.
297720	301080	And I keep saying to myself over and over again,
301080	303080	is this happening?
303080	304240	This isn't happening.
305320	307480	Is this really happening?
307480	312480	I think I'm told not to move or make a sound,
314560	316440	but I can't be sure.
316440	320280	He asks me for money, but I don't have any.
320280	321680	No, wait, I do.
321680	324240	I have 75 pence.
324240	325920	I think he thinks I'm mocking him,
325920	328320	so I give him my bag and he turns me around
328320	330560	and he pushes me up against the phone.
332400	334760	And through the sheer panic of it all,
335600	337560	something happened to me.
338920	342520	I was suddenly overcome by this strange sense
342520	345680	of calm, presence and lucidity.
346920	348680	My senses were heightened
348680	352560	and I could feel and sense everything around me.
352560	357040	It was like I was inhabiting every cell of my body
357040	359800	and I think time must have stood still or something
359800	363160	because after that everything happened in slow motion.
365040	367080	The voice in my head asks me,
368840	372520	so how does this end?
372520	374160	What happens now?
375560	378040	And so I start running through all these different scenarios
378040	379040	in my mind.
380280	383160	Or maybe I'm stabbed and I die.
384680	388560	Or maybe I'm raped, stabbed and then I die.
389760	393520	Or maybe, maybe I'm stabbed,
393520	395520	but I go into intensive care,
397240	400680	but then I slip into a coma and then I die.
402320	403920	And the voice says,
403920	405320	well, whatever way you look at this,
405320	407680	you really have nothing to lose.
407680	411920	But if you do survive, the police will want a description.
411920	413840	You need to get a description.
415320	420320	So I slowly raise my hands and I turn around to face him.
421320	424440	And I tell him to check my pockets for money
424440	426400	just in case he doesn't believe me.
427600	431040	And as he does, I look at him
432440	434560	and I take the image of him in.
436080	439800	The colour of his hair, his eyes,
441360	444240	his clothing, his height,
446480	448400	and the Stanley knife in his hand.
450560	454360	He looks up and he notices the tracking movements of my eyes
454360	456160	and he quickly turns me around
456160	458320	and he forces me up against the phone.
459440	462920	His hands start to move over my breasts.
464640	468000	And the voice says, don't move.
469240	470800	Don't even flinch.
471960	473240	Let him touch you.
474680	476320	Let him think he has you.
478720	479960	And so I do.
480920	483560	Let him touch me.
485720	486920	And for a brief moment,
486920	490960	I can almost sense a slight release of tension in his arm.
492120	494600	And all the while, I kept thinking to myself,
494600	496200	how did I get into the phone box?
496200	497520	Which way did the door open?
497520	499280	What side of the door was the handle on?
499280	500960	Which hand did I use?
502720	507720	Meanwhile, his hands are travelling downwards
508120	509520	towards my groin.
511120	513000	And in that moment, I decide,
514640	515840	I'd rather die.
518280	520520	I grab his arms and I use my weight
520520	522840	to push him backwards into the door.
522840	525240	And using my elbows, I swing to the right
525240	527040	so that as I swing to the left,
527040	530160	I use his weight to leverage the door open.
530160	533720	And the door opens and so I run.
533720	535440	And I'm screaming, I think.
537000	538520	But then I stop running
538520	540000	because I realise very quickly
540000	542240	he's not chasing me.
542240	543360	He's run away.
545320	546800	I don't know what it was in that moment
546800	549800	if it was just the effects of the adrenaline.
549800	551960	But all I wanted to do was find him
551960	554320	so that I could stab him and kill him.
555160	558400	But as I'm looking around, I don't see anyone,
558400	561360	apart from an Indian man standing in the driveway
561360	563880	of his house next to his car.
563880	566160	He shouts to me, are you okay?
566160	569120	Of course I'm not okay, I've just been mugged.
569120	570440	Which way did he go?
571360	574400	I start running down a dark road
574400	576720	and the man chases me and brings me back,
576720	578920	telling me it's not a good idea.
578920	581400	He walks me to the phone box
581400	585320	where I pick up my bag and I replace the handset.
585320	586840	And the phone rings.
587800	590960	And so, for some bizarre reason, I answer it.
592680	594000	It's my boyfriend.
596440	598160	He tells me he's been trying to call me
598160	600080	for the last two minutes.
601040	601880	What?
602840	603960	Are you sure?
605800	610200	I hang up and then the Indian man offers to drive me home.
610200	612920	I tell him he's crazy, I'm not getting in a car with you.
612920	615360	You're a stranger, you're a man.
616400	619960	He offers to bring his wife along so that I feel safe.
619960	621960	It's just that now I have to wait for her
621960	625680	because she has to get ready and get her purse.
625680	628040	So as I stand outside the door,
628040	629640	waiting for her,
629640	632680	every single member of the family appears at the door
632680	634400	wanting to know what happened,
634400	636320	wanting to come along for the ride.
638120	640960	Eventually, everyone is seated in the car.
644200	646120	Everyone except for me.
647280	649240	There's no room for me to sit.
649240	651800	Someone has to get out of the car
651800	655720	so that I can get in, so that I can go home.
656720	660400	Eventually, it's agreed that the grandfather will stay behind.
663080	667440	The drive is excruciatingly slow
667440	672440	owing to the weight of the car and so claustrophobic.
673480	677520	I burst into tears and the grandmother says,
677520	680680	stop crying, what are you crying for?
680680	682240	It's not like you were raped.
683240	686520	Oh, wait a minute, she says.
686520	688880	He didn't touch you down there, did he?
691920	693600	No?
693600	695760	Well, that's all right then
695760	698120	because otherwise you would have been spoiled.
701760	705760	We get to the car park and I ask to be let down.
705760	709240	They offer to walk me to my door and I flat out refuse.
710120	712560	As I watch the car pull away,
715040	718000	I realise as I stand in this dark car park,
719480	720760	I'm breathing again.
721840	726080	It's only in that moment I realise I'm home.
727040	728440	I made it home.
729760	730600	Thank you.

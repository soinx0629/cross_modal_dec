0	3880	I first started taking care of other people's children
3880	7560	when I was actually still just a child myself.
7560	11240	So that meant people were paying me basically to play,
11240	13520	and that was really awesome.
13520	17960	But it also meant that I was getting a ton of childcare experience,
17960	19880	and that by the time I was 16,
19880	24320	I probably could make macaroni and cheese with my eyes shut,
24320	27880	or change a diaper with one hand tied behind my back,
28000	31400	which I only probably ever would have had to do
31400	34760	with those very naughty Nicholson boys.
34760	37000	But their mother knew they were a handful.
37000	40440	She was paying $10 an hour in 1988.
40440	42680	Laughter
42680	46560	So I kind of thought that all of my childcare experience
46560	48120	was going to teach me everything
48120	51640	that I needed to know about parenting my own children.
51640	55520	And my husband and I, we had a daughter and then a son,
55600	58600	and then we decided to become foster parents
58600	62880	with the intention of hopefully being able to adopt one day.
62880	64800	And you know how everybody always says,
64800	66960	you need a license to drive a car,
66960	69640	but you don't need one to have a child?
69640	70880	That's not true.
70880	74360	When you become a foster parent, we did have to get a license.
74360	77080	And so first we had to take these classes
77080	80320	where they asked us really hard-hitting questions,
80320	84120	like, is secondhand smoke good or bad?
84120	85240	Laughter
86040	89160	Do babies actually need car seats?
90040	93200	And then we had to do all sorts of other things,
93200	95880	have physicals done, background checks,
95880	98720	fingerprinted, have our home inspected, interviews.
98720	100000	I mean, the whole thing turned out
100000	102280	to be way more complicated
102280	105560	than just creating a new human being with my body.
107560	110160	And then there were all the questions.
110160	113200	What kind of child would we be willing to take?
113200	114360	A girl or a boy?
114360	115200	What race?
116160	117280	What age?
117280	120480	Now, I grew up with three sisters,
120480	122320	and I already had one boy
122320	124640	that I didn't always know how to relate to,
124640	128840	but then I heard that boys are actually left behind more
128840	130760	in adoption requests.
130760	134720	So we said that we preferred a boy, any race,
134720	137560	and having survived two infants already,
137560	138880	we thought that that pleasure
138880	141040	could be afforded to someone else.
141040	143120	So anything up to age four,
143120	145240	I had a biological son at the time,
145240	146760	and we got our license in the mail,
146760	148480	and we settled in for what we thought
148480	149840	could be a very long wait,
149840	153120	but we got a phone call six weeks later
153120	156160	about a baby at the hospital,
156160	159440	and I thought, wow, an infant.
159440	162360	Doesn't everybody else want an infant?
162360	164760	Laughter
164760	166000	But we said yes,
166000	168680	and when we went to the hospital to pick him up,
168680	172680	the nurses insisted on pushing me out to the car
172680	173840	in a wheelchair.
173840	176360	Laughter
176360	177640	Which I thought was very funny.
177640	180120	I mean, I didn't suffer any physical distress
180120	181920	bringing this kid into the world,
181920	184520	and even though I thought it was really funny, though,
184520	188120	I realized I was having the same exact,
188120	190520	overwhelmingly surreal sensation
190520	192600	that I had when I first left the hospital
192600	193680	with my first two babies,
193680	196440	and that was there's a new person here.
196440	197880	There's this new human being
197880	201200	that's so tiny and perfect and amazing,
201240	204760	and this hospital staff is gonna let us just leave with him
204760	206760	even though they look really competent.
206760	209000	Laughter
209000	210320	And we got him home,
210320	213000	and it became obvious right away
213000	215320	that there were things that we still needed to learn
215320	219000	in spite of years of babysitting and parenting experience
219000	221480	and having a license to parent,
221480	225040	like what to do when a young woman comes bouncing up to you
225040	226640	and says, your baby is so cute.
226640	228800	Is his daddy black?
228840	232040	So I just pretended I couldn't really remember.
232040	236400	Laughter
236400	241240	Or what to do when a woman taps you on the shoulder
241240	243600	at a crowded restaurant and demands to know,
243600	245440	where's that baby from?
245440	248200	And when told, New Jersey,
248200	251120	just continues to keep asking, but where before that?
251120	252920	But where before that until you're finally
252920	254920	just forced to say, a uterus?
254920	257680	Laughter
257720	261440	Or what to do when your four-year-old white son
261440	264680	comes running up and says, we're playing circus,
264680	267720	and the baby has to be the monkey because he's brown,
267720	269960	and your African-American caseworker is visiting,
269960	270960	and all you can think to do
270960	274320	is that you just wanna die on the spot.
274320	276880	And so instead, you just pretend you didn't hear him
276880	278640	and make a strong mental note
278640	280640	to talk to him about that later.
282960	284960	I don't think they told us anything
284960	288080	about transracial adoption in those classes.
288080	289800	The most they might have said
289800	291800	was something along the lines of,
291800	294880	if you're white and have a black child placed with you,
294880	296400	please, for the love of God,
296400	299240	get some help with their skin and hair.
299240	302760	And so I turned to my black friends and I asked for help,
302760	305440	and they helped me, and they also taught me things
305440	308720	like that my little black boy was only gonna be cute
308720	312000	in the eyes of the public for a certain age,
312000	315000	and then he would somehow overnight
315000	317560	be perceived as threatening to the public
317560	319840	and that it was gonna happen much sooner
319840	322040	than I would anticipate.
322040	324080	And I listened to them and I learned from them,
324080	328680	but I didn't experience any of that harsh reality yet.
328680	330000	And our case moved along
330000	333560	and we were given the go-ahead to adopt him.
333560	335360	And I got some paperwork in the mail.
335360	337720	It was an adoption subsidy agreement.
337720	341680	And next to the name of our adorable, funny,
341720	344560	very loved and very wanted son
344560	346800	was the reason for the monthly subsidy
346800	348200	that he was gonna get.
348200	350600	And it was checked off,
350600	354240	child is hard to place African-American.
355520	358120	And I felt like I had been punched in the stomach.
359360	362120	And then one day we got a phone call from our caseworker
362120	363200	and I wasn't expecting it,
363200	364560	and I could tell something was up
364560	366840	and I was right because she said,
366840	369400	do you have room for another baby?
369400	372240	And we weren't really planning on having any more children,
372240	375120	but we loved our little son so much.
375120	376920	We loved any sibling of his.
376920	379680	And so I said, what is it?
379680	380720	And she said, a boy.
380720	383080	And so I cried a little when I said, okay.
384320	386160	And then I said, I guess I better call my husband
386160	387680	and ask him real quick though.
391040	393720	So then we were up to four children,
393720	395360	one girl and three boys.
395360	399880	And I was pretty sure that I was done with babies.
399880	401880	But then I went to a baby shower
402800	404920	and all the new mom was opening up
404920	407840	all these tiny little socks and really cute onesies
407840	410640	and things and all the women were just gushing.
410640	413480	And I realized that I was sitting like a little bit away
413480	415720	from the rest of them and just thinking
415720	418640	that looks like more laundry to me.
419800	423680	So then I really knew that I was done with babies
423680	428680	until I get a phone call about our boy's baby sister.
429040	430760	And could we come get her like today?
430760	432120	Did we have a car seat?
433400	436000	And so even though we knew it meant getting on
436000	439560	another two-year emotional roller coaster,
439560	442920	we borrowed a car seat and said yes.
442920	446920	Six years after starting our fostering experience,
446920	449280	we had adopted each of our children.
449280	453040	We got to say goodbye to the judges and the caseworkers
453040	455800	and good riddance to the one that we referred to
455800	458120	as the anti-social worker.
458120	463120	And hello to the architect and the contractors.
466360	468080	Lessons were still being learned
468080	469920	and mistakes were being made.
469920	473040	I can admit that I have been that white mom
473040	475120	out at the store when a black woman told me
475120	478120	that my baby's hair felt a little bit dry.
478120	481080	And I knew I had to learn from all these different sources,
481080	483600	the black community, adult adoptees,
483600	486400	more experienced transracially adopted families,
486400	488520	and all while trying to balance it
488520	491440	with what it meant to be our family
491440	493520	in this time and in this place.
493520	496240	And I thought we were doing all right.
496240	498960	And then one day my son was getting ready for school.
498960	503360	He was six years old and getting ready for first grade
503360	506040	and he was brushing his teeth and he just stopped.
506040	509760	And he said, I wish a brown family adopted me.
510760	512080	He wasn't upset.
512080	513720	He was very matter of fact,
513720	515560	like I wanna wear my blue sneakers
515560	517680	and I wish a brown family adopted me.
517680	520600	But I was stunned.
520600	523320	I knew he might say something like that at some point,
523320	525360	but I just wasn't really expecting it.
525360	528760	And so I just tried to stay calm.
528760	531400	And I said, oh, well, how come?
531400	534960	And he said, I want the family to look like me.
534960	536560	And so I pointed out that his younger brother
536560	537840	and sister looked like him.
537840	540400	And he said, yeah, but not the whole family.
541560	543760	And so I just apologized.
543760	545960	I didn't know what else I could possibly do.
545960	548440	And I got him off to school and the whole day
548440	551480	I was thinking, what am I gonna do about this?
551480	553160	And on one hand, I didn't wanna do anything.
553160	554680	I mean, the kid seems fine.
554680	557880	I don't wanna bother him, get him upset about it.
557880	561400	But on the other hand, you have to muddle things up
561400	563680	sometimes before you get some clarity.
563680	567440	So at bedtime that night, I muddled things up
567480	570640	and I asked him, are you still feeling sad
570640	573440	that a Brown family didn't adopt you?
573440	577400	And he didn't say anything, he just nodded yes.
577400	581040	So I said, did anybody do anything
581040	583280	or say something recently that made you start
583280	584200	to feel that way?
584200	588360	And again, he just nodded no.
588360	590360	So now I'm grasping for straws.
590360	593880	Did you know that daddy and I love you very, very, very,
594280	595520	very much?
595520	599400	And again, just a nod, yes.
599400	601640	I mean, clearly the kid was not gonna help me
601640	604560	move the conversation forward at all.
605640	607320	So I had no idea what to say.
607320	609880	And so I absolutely surprised myself
609880	611000	with what came out next.
611000	612920	And I said to him, did you know
612920	616120	that there's sadness to adoption?
616120	617880	And this time his interest was piqued
617880	621600	because this time he spoke and he said, no, I didn't.
622560	625240	And I said, well, yeah, most of the time
625240	628960	everybody only talks about how really happy adoption is.
628960	633040	And we are so, so happy that you're part of our family.
633040	635880	But if the world was perfect
635880	637920	and there were never any problems at all,
637920	641360	you probably could have just stayed with your first mommy.
641360	642320	Don't you think?
643200	645840	And this time my boy answered me.
645840	650000	It wasn't with a nod or with words, but he sobbed.
650000	652240	It wasn't crying over a skinny,
652240	655200	he was sobbing over an emotional wound
655200	656960	that he didn't know he had.
656960	659200	And he still lacked the emotional maturity
659200	661160	and the language to really explore it.
661160	665600	But there was something about my acknowledging it for him
665600	668200	that just unlocked the deepest sob
668200	671160	I'd ever heard come out of a little child.
671160	674080	And I told him it was okay to be sad about that
674080	675360	and maybe even forever,
675360	679040	but that I wanted to help him find peace over it.
679040	681440	And would he maybe like to try to meet
681440	683000	some more of his birth family?
683000	684920	And he said, yes.
686000	688040	So I reached out to our last caseworker
688040	690680	and I said, I had heard about this great grandma.
690680	693240	Can you give me her number or something?
693240	697560	And he said, no, I'm actually not allowed to give that out.
697560	700520	So I did a little more asking around and some research
700520	702480	and I found out that he could, however,
702480	705400	send a letter on my behalf.
705400	707600	Now, based on my history with the state,
707600	709560	I didn't really trust that this was gonna happen,
709560	710800	but I had to take a chance.
710800	713880	I wrote the letter and I sent it and hoped for the best.
713880	718600	And it worked because she called us a week or two later,
718600	721520	this great grandmother who had worried about them
721520	722880	and prayed for them for years.
722880	725560	And we went to go meet her immediately.
725560	728640	And as soon as we did, all these doors kept opening
728640	730120	because every time we went,
730120	732720	we just would meet a new family member.
732720	736280	And each one of them welcomed all of us,
736280	738440	our adopted kids, our biological kids,
738440	741520	my husband and myself with open arms.
741520	742920	And all these relationships
742920	746240	that could have felt awkward or strange just never did.
746240	749000	And our children thrived because of it.
750360	752480	And that was four years ago.
752480	753840	And on a more recent visit,
753840	756600	I was sitting catching up with the kids' auntie
756600	759720	like on a couch over here and I could see my husband eating
759720	762140	and talking with another family member over there.
762140	765200	And some of my kids were doing crafts with some cousins
765200	767200	and others were running around playing Ninja Turtles
767200	768120	with other cousins.
768120	770680	And there was Pop Pop sitting on the couch
770680	773880	and he had the TV on, the nature channel way too loud,
773880	776760	like he always has it and I know that now.
776760	779560	And there was my son just snuggled up by his side
779560	783640	and treating wild animal facts with his grandfather.
783640	785560	And looking around the room that day,
785560	788180	I saw to myself, growing up,
788180	793160	I always thought that adoption just meant a new family
793160	795700	for the children that are adopted.
795700	799060	But looking around here, I know that in our case,
799060	803400	it means so much more because it's a family for all of us.

00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
I first started taking care of other people's children

00:03.880 --> 00:07.560
when I was actually still just a child myself.

00:07.560 --> 00:11.240
So that meant people were paying me basically to play,

00:11.240 --> 00:13.520
and that was really awesome.

00:13.520 --> 00:17.960
But it also meant that I was getting a ton of childcare experience,

00:17.960 --> 00:19.880
and that by the time I was 16,

00:19.880 --> 00:24.320
I probably could make macaroni and cheese with my eyes shut,

00:24.320 --> 00:27.880
or change a diaper with one hand tied behind my back,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.400
which I only probably ever would have had to do

00:31.400 --> 00:34.760
with those very naughty Nicholson boys.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.000
But their mother knew they were a handful.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.440
She was paying $10 an hour in 1988.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.680
Laughter

00:42.680 --> 00:46.560
So I kind of thought that all of my childcare experience

00:46.560 --> 00:48.120
was going to teach me everything

00:48.120 --> 00:51.640
that I needed to know about parenting my own children.

00:51.640 --> 00:55.520
And my husband and I, we had a daughter and then a son,

00:55.600 --> 00:58.600
and then we decided to become foster parents

00:58.600 --> 01:02.880
with the intention of hopefully being able to adopt one day.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.800
And you know how everybody always says,

01:04.800 --> 01:06.960
you need a license to drive a car,

01:06.960 --> 01:09.640
but you don't need one to have a child?

01:09.640 --> 01:10.880
That's not true.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.360
When you become a foster parent, we did have to get a license.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.080
And so first we had to take these classes

01:17.080 --> 01:20.320
where they asked us really hard-hitting questions,

01:20.320 --> 01:24.120
like, is secondhand smoke good or bad?

01:24.120 --> 01:25.240
Laughter

01:26.040 --> 01:29.160
Do babies actually need car seats?

01:30.040 --> 01:33.200
And then we had to do all sorts of other things,

01:33.200 --> 01:35.880
have physicals done, background checks,

01:35.880 --> 01:38.720
fingerprinted, have our home inspected, interviews.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.000
I mean, the whole thing turned out

01:40.000 --> 01:42.280
to be way more complicated

01:42.280 --> 01:45.560
than just creating a new human being with my body.

01:47.560 --> 01:50.160
And then there were all the questions.

01:50.160 --> 01:53.200
What kind of child would we be willing to take?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.360
A girl or a boy?

01:54.360 --> 01:55.200
What race?

01:56.160 --> 01:57.280
What age?

01:57.280 --> 02:00.480
Now, I grew up with three sisters,

02:00.480 --> 02:02.320
and I already had one boy

02:02.320 --> 02:04.640
that I didn't always know how to relate to,

02:04.640 --> 02:08.840
but then I heard that boys are actually left behind more

02:08.840 --> 02:10.760
in adoption requests.

02:10.760 --> 02:14.720
So we said that we preferred a boy, any race,

02:14.720 --> 02:17.560
and having survived two infants already,

02:17.560 --> 02:18.880
we thought that that pleasure

02:18.880 --> 02:21.040
could be afforded to someone else.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.120
So anything up to age four,

02:23.120 --> 02:25.240
I had a biological son at the time,

02:25.240 --> 02:26.760
and we got our license in the mail,

02:26.760 --> 02:28.480
and we settled in for what we thought

02:28.480 --> 02:29.840
could be a very long wait,

02:29.840 --> 02:33.120
but we got a phone call six weeks later

02:33.120 --> 02:36.160
about a baby at the hospital,

02:36.160 --> 02:39.440
and I thought, wow, an infant.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.360
Doesn't everybody else want an infant?

02:42.360 --> 02:44.760
Laughter

02:44.760 --> 02:46.000
But we said yes,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.680
and when we went to the hospital to pick him up,

02:48.680 --> 02:52.680
the nurses insisted on pushing me out to the car

02:52.680 --> 02:53.840
in a wheelchair.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.360
Laughter

02:56.360 --> 02:57.640
Which I thought was very funny.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.120
I mean, I didn't suffer any physical distress

03:00.120 --> 03:01.920
bringing this kid into the world,

03:01.920 --> 03:04.520
and even though I thought it was really funny, though,

03:04.520 --> 03:08.120
I realized I was having the same exact,

03:08.120 --> 03:10.520
overwhelmingly surreal sensation

03:10.520 --> 03:12.600
that I had when I first left the hospital

03:12.600 --> 03:13.680
with my first two babies,

03:13.680 --> 03:16.440
and that was there's a new person here.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.880
There's this new human being

03:17.880 --> 03:21.200
that's so tiny and perfect and amazing,

03:21.240 --> 03:24.760
and this hospital staff is gonna let us just leave with him

03:24.760 --> 03:26.760
even though they look really competent.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.000
Laughter

03:29.000 --> 03:30.320
And we got him home,

03:30.320 --> 03:33.000
and it became obvious right away

03:33.000 --> 03:35.320
that there were things that we still needed to learn

03:35.320 --> 03:39.000
in spite of years of babysitting and parenting experience

03:39.000 --> 03:41.480
and having a license to parent,

03:41.480 --> 03:45.040
like what to do when a young woman comes bouncing up to you

03:45.040 --> 03:46.640
and says, your baby is so cute.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.800
Is his daddy black?

03:48.840 --> 03:52.040
So I just pretended I couldn't really remember.

03:52.040 --> 03:56.400
Laughter

03:56.400 --> 04:01.240
Or what to do when a woman taps you on the shoulder

04:01.240 --> 04:03.600
at a crowded restaurant and demands to know,

04:03.600 --> 04:05.440
where's that baby from?

04:05.440 --> 04:08.200
And when told, New Jersey,

04:08.200 --> 04:11.120
just continues to keep asking, but where before that?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.920
But where before that until you're finally

04:12.920 --> 04:14.920
just forced to say, a uterus?

04:14.920 --> 04:17.680
Laughter

04:17.720 --> 04:21.440
Or what to do when your four-year-old white son

04:21.440 --> 04:24.680
comes running up and says, we're playing circus,

04:24.680 --> 04:27.720
and the baby has to be the monkey because he's brown,

04:27.720 --> 04:29.960
and your African-American caseworker is visiting,

04:29.960 --> 04:30.960
and all you can think to do

04:30.960 --> 04:34.320
is that you just wanna die on the spot.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.880
And so instead, you just pretend you didn't hear him

04:36.880 --> 04:38.640
and make a strong mental note

04:38.640 --> 04:40.640
to talk to him about that later.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.960
I don't think they told us anything

04:44.960 --> 04:48.080
about transracial adoption in those classes.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.800
The most they might have said

04:49.800 --> 04:51.800
was something along the lines of,

04:51.800 --> 04:54.880
if you're white and have a black child placed with you,

04:54.880 --> 04:56.400
please, for the love of God,

04:56.400 --> 04:59.240
get some help with their skin and hair.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.760
And so I turned to my black friends and I asked for help,

05:02.760 --> 05:05.440
and they helped me, and they also taught me things

05:05.440 --> 05:08.720
like that my little black boy was only gonna be cute

05:08.720 --> 05:12.000
in the eyes of the public for a certain age,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
and then he would somehow overnight

05:15.000 --> 05:17.560
be perceived as threatening to the public

05:17.560 --> 05:19.840
and that it was gonna happen much sooner

05:19.840 --> 05:22.040
than I would anticipate.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.080
And I listened to them and I learned from them,

05:24.080 --> 05:28.680
but I didn't experience any of that harsh reality yet.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.000
And our case moved along

05:30.000 --> 05:33.560
and we were given the go-ahead to adopt him.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.360
And I got some paperwork in the mail.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.720
It was an adoption subsidy agreement.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.680
And next to the name of our adorable, funny,

05:41.720 --> 05:44.560
very loved and very wanted son

05:44.560 --> 05:46.800
was the reason for the monthly subsidy

05:46.800 --> 05:48.200
that he was gonna get.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.600
And it was checked off,

05:50.600 --> 05:54.240
child is hard to place African-American.

05:55.520 --> 05:58.120
And I felt like I had been punched in the stomach.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.120
And then one day we got a phone call from our caseworker

06:02.120 --> 06:03.200
and I wasn't expecting it,

06:03.200 --> 06:04.560
and I could tell something was up

06:04.560 --> 06:06.840
and I was right because she said,

06:06.840 --> 06:09.400
do you have room for another baby?

06:09.400 --> 06:12.240
And we weren't really planning on having any more children,

06:12.240 --> 06:15.120
but we loved our little son so much.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.920
We loved any sibling of his.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.680
And so I said, what is it?

06:19.680 --> 06:20.720
And she said, a boy.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.080
And so I cried a little when I said, okay.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.160
And then I said, I guess I better call my husband

06:26.160 --> 06:27.680
and ask him real quick though.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.720
So then we were up to four children,

06:33.720 --> 06:35.360
one girl and three boys.

06:35.360 --> 06:39.880
And I was pretty sure that I was done with babies.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.880
But then I went to a baby shower

06:42.800 --> 06:44.920
and all the new mom was opening up

06:44.920 --> 06:47.840
all these tiny little socks and really cute onesies

06:47.840 --> 06:50.640
and things and all the women were just gushing.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.480
And I realized that I was sitting like a little bit away

06:53.480 --> 06:55.720
from the rest of them and just thinking

06:55.720 --> 06:58.640
that looks like more laundry to me.

06:59.800 --> 07:03.680
So then I really knew that I was done with babies

07:03.680 --> 07:08.680
until I get a phone call about our boy's baby sister.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.760
And could we come get her like today?

07:10.760 --> 07:12.120
Did we have a car seat?

07:13.400 --> 07:16.000
And so even though we knew it meant getting on

07:16.000 --> 07:19.560
another two-year emotional roller coaster,

07:19.560 --> 07:22.920
we borrowed a car seat and said yes.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.920
Six years after starting our fostering experience,

07:26.920 --> 07:29.280
we had adopted each of our children.

07:29.280 --> 07:33.040
We got to say goodbye to the judges and the caseworkers

07:33.040 --> 07:35.800
and good riddance to the one that we referred to

07:35.800 --> 07:38.120
as the anti-social worker.

07:38.120 --> 07:43.120
And hello to the architect and the contractors.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.080
Lessons were still being learned

07:48.080 --> 07:49.920
and mistakes were being made.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.040
I can admit that I have been that white mom

07:53.040 --> 07:55.120
out at the store when a black woman told me

07:55.120 --> 07:58.120
that my baby's hair felt a little bit dry.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.080
And I knew I had to learn from all these different sources,

08:01.080 --> 08:03.600
the black community, adult adoptees,

08:03.600 --> 08:06.400
more experienced transracially adopted families,

08:06.400 --> 08:08.520
and all while trying to balance it

08:08.520 --> 08:11.440
with what it meant to be our family

08:11.440 --> 08:13.520
in this time and in this place.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.240
And I thought we were doing all right.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.960
And then one day my son was getting ready for school.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.360
He was six years old and getting ready for first grade

08:23.360 --> 08:26.040
and he was brushing his teeth and he just stopped.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.760
And he said, I wish a brown family adopted me.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.080
He wasn't upset.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.720
He was very matter of fact,

08:33.720 --> 08:35.560
like I wanna wear my blue sneakers

08:35.560 --> 08:37.680
and I wish a brown family adopted me.

08:37.680 --> 08:40.600
But I was stunned.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.320
I knew he might say something like that at some point,

08:43.320 --> 08:45.360
but I just wasn't really expecting it.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.760
And so I just tried to stay calm.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.400
And I said, oh, well, how come?

08:51.400 --> 08:54.960
And he said, I want the family to look like me.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.560
And so I pointed out that his younger brother

08:56.560 --> 08:57.840
and sister looked like him.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.400
And he said, yeah, but not the whole family.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.760
And so I just apologized.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.960
I didn't know what else I could possibly do.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.440
And I got him off to school and the whole day

09:08.440 --> 09:11.480
I was thinking, what am I gonna do about this?

09:11.480 --> 09:13.160
And on one hand, I didn't wanna do anything.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.680
I mean, the kid seems fine.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.880
I don't wanna bother him, get him upset about it.

09:17.880 --> 09:21.400
But on the other hand, you have to muddle things up

09:21.400 --> 09:23.680
sometimes before you get some clarity.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.440
So at bedtime that night, I muddled things up

09:27.480 --> 09:30.640
and I asked him, are you still feeling sad

09:30.640 --> 09:33.440
that a Brown family didn't adopt you?

09:33.440 --> 09:37.400
And he didn't say anything, he just nodded yes.

09:37.400 --> 09:41.040
So I said, did anybody do anything

09:41.040 --> 09:43.280
or say something recently that made you start

09:43.280 --> 09:44.200
to feel that way?

09:44.200 --> 09:48.360
And again, he just nodded no.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.360
So now I'm grasping for straws.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.880
Did you know that daddy and I love you very, very, very,

09:54.280 --> 09:55.520
very much?

09:55.520 --> 09:59.400
And again, just a nod, yes.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.640
I mean, clearly the kid was not gonna help me

10:01.640 --> 10:04.560
move the conversation forward at all.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.320
So I had no idea what to say.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.880
And so I absolutely surprised myself

10:09.880 --> 10:11.000
with what came out next.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.920
And I said to him, did you know

10:12.920 --> 10:16.120
that there's sadness to adoption?

10:16.120 --> 10:17.880
And this time his interest was piqued

10:17.880 --> 10:21.600
because this time he spoke and he said, no, I didn't.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.240
And I said, well, yeah, most of the time

10:25.240 --> 10:28.960
everybody only talks about how really happy adoption is.

10:28.960 --> 10:33.040
And we are so, so happy that you're part of our family.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.880
But if the world was perfect

10:35.880 --> 10:37.920
and there were never any problems at all,

10:37.920 --> 10:41.360
you probably could have just stayed with your first mommy.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.320
Don't you think?

10:43.200 --> 10:45.840
And this time my boy answered me.

10:45.840 --> 10:50.000
It wasn't with a nod or with words, but he sobbed.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.240
It wasn't crying over a skinny,

10:52.240 --> 10:55.200
he was sobbing over an emotional wound

10:55.200 --> 10:56.960
that he didn't know he had.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.200
And he still lacked the emotional maturity

10:59.200 --> 11:01.160
and the language to really explore it.

11:01.160 --> 11:05.600
But there was something about my acknowledging it for him

11:05.600 --> 11:08.200
that just unlocked the deepest sob

11:08.200 --> 11:11.160
I'd ever heard come out of a little child.

11:11.160 --> 11:14.080
And I told him it was okay to be sad about that

11:14.080 --> 11:15.360
and maybe even forever,

11:15.360 --> 11:19.040
but that I wanted to help him find peace over it.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.440
And would he maybe like to try to meet

11:21.440 --> 11:23.000
some more of his birth family?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.920
And he said, yes.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.040
So I reached out to our last caseworker

11:28.040 --> 11:30.680
and I said, I had heard about this great grandma.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.240
Can you give me her number or something?

11:33.240 --> 11:37.560
And he said, no, I'm actually not allowed to give that out.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.520
So I did a little more asking around and some research

11:40.520 --> 11:42.480
and I found out that he could, however,

11:42.480 --> 11:45.400
send a letter on my behalf.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.600
Now, based on my history with the state,

11:47.600 --> 11:49.560
I didn't really trust that this was gonna happen,

11:49.560 --> 11:50.800
but I had to take a chance.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.880
I wrote the letter and I sent it and hoped for the best.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.600
And it worked because she called us a week or two later,

11:58.600 --> 12:01.520
this great grandmother who had worried about them

12:01.520 --> 12:02.880
and prayed for them for years.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.560
And we went to go meet her immediately.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.640
And as soon as we did, all these doors kept opening

12:08.640 --> 12:10.120
because every time we went,

12:10.120 --> 12:12.720
we just would meet a new family member.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.280
And each one of them welcomed all of us,

12:16.280 --> 12:18.440
our adopted kids, our biological kids,

12:18.440 --> 12:21.520
my husband and myself with open arms.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.920
And all these relationships

12:22.920 --> 12:26.240
that could have felt awkward or strange just never did.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.000
And our children thrived because of it.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.480
And that was four years ago.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.840
And on a more recent visit,

12:33.840 --> 12:36.600
I was sitting catching up with the kids' auntie

12:36.600 --> 12:39.720
like on a couch over here and I could see my husband eating

12:39.720 --> 12:42.140
and talking with another family member over there.

12:42.140 --> 12:45.200
And some of my kids were doing crafts with some cousins

12:45.200 --> 12:47.200
and others were running around playing Ninja Turtles

12:47.200 --> 12:48.120
with other cousins.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.680
And there was Pop Pop sitting on the couch

12:50.680 --> 12:53.880
and he had the TV on, the nature channel way too loud,

12:53.880 --> 12:56.760
like he always has it and I know that now.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.560
And there was my son just snuggled up by his side

12:59.560 --> 13:03.640
and treating wild animal facts with his grandfather.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.560
And looking around the room that day,

13:05.560 --> 13:08.180
I saw to myself, growing up,

13:08.180 --> 13:13.160
I always thought that adoption just meant a new family

13:13.160 --> 13:15.700
for the children that are adopted.

13:15.700 --> 13:19.060
But looking around here, I know that in our case,

13:19.060 --> 13:23.400
it means so much more because it's a family for all of us.

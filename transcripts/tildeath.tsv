0	9240	It was five days before my ten-year high school reunion when my husband told me he thought
9240	12000	he might be gay.
12000	16480	He wasn't sure he was gay because he had never been with a man yet, but he thought it was
16480	18640	something he ought to figure out.
18640	20800	Good idea.
20800	25080	Now I think he told me this at that moment, not to get out of my high school reunion,
25080	29480	which would be understandable, but in order to, because we had been looking for houses
29480	32840	together and we'd finally found one in Pasadena that we both liked.
32840	37080	And I think somehow the forever of a wedding vow sounded kind of vague and idealistic to
37080	40480	him where his 30-year mortgage was surprisingly specific.
40480	45520	It was a commitment, you know, the kind of commitment you shouldn't make while your sexuality
45520	48520	is pending.
48520	55840	Now, as he was explaining this to me, I was thinking downstairs, our neighbors, we lived
55840	59480	in this duplex apartment we were renting, the Kaufmans were probably just sitting down
59480	63600	to dinner as they'd done for 52 years and talking about their brisket, and they were
63600	68120	this couple that used to come up and see our new furniture, like when we bought a new antique
68120	79120	table because Sam liked antique shopping, pink flag, and so they were like parent figures
79120	80120	to us.
80120	84240	And, you know, there were signs, like when I first met Sam, he had this leather jacket
84240	89120	with tiger print lining, and I remember thinking it seemed kind of, the lining, I don't know
89760	90760	it stuck with me.
90760	96080	And then, you know, but then he asked me out, and we slept together, and he asked me to
96080	103600	marry him, and I put on the big white dress, which he helped me pick out in front, seriously,
103600	108480	in front of, you know, 200 of my closest friends, and I figured he's not.
108480	113000	And also, I actually, I guess there was one thing I ignored, which I probably should have
113000	114000	paid attention to.
114000	118400	He told me before we were, while we were engaged, he told me he sometimes noticed men, but he
118400	121920	said he couldn't imagine sleeping with a man, and, you know, he just noticed them.
121920	125560	And I guess I knew this was not good because I didn't talk to any girlfriends about this,
125560	127840	and I talk to girlfriends about everything.
127840	129400	So if I didn't, it was probably bad.
129400	132480	But I did, at one point, I did talk to one girlfriend, we were in line at Disneyland
132480	136120	for Space Mountain, and I told her how Sam had said he sometimes noticed men, and do
136120	137120	you think that's bad?
137120	141040	And she said, you know, she told me this theory of the spectrum of sexuality, and everyone
141040	145000	lies somewhere along it, and some people notice people, but they would never act on it.
145600	149680	Four years later, she realized she was a lesbian.
149680	153360	My one person I confess to.
153360	159080	So as I was recalling all these signs, I realized Sam was still talking, and he was telling
159080	162720	me he felt so much better getting this off his chest, and he'd been wanting to tell me
162720	168760	for a long time, and he felt so relieved, he kind of wanted to have sex.
168760	170520	And I said, with who?
171040	173040	And he said, with you.
173040	178560	And I think he meant it as a compliment, but I have to go to bed and wake up when the bookstores
178560	179560	are open.
179560	187800	So the next day, I went directly to the self-help section, where all problems could be solved,
187800	192080	and there was no book for someone whose husband thought he might be gay.
192080	195840	There was a book called Loving Someone Gay, but it turned out to be for teachers and family
195840	199400	members, but nothing.
199400	203760	And I was nervous because this is LA, and I didn't want to pioneer a problem.
203760	208320	This is a very bad sign.
208320	213680	And as I'm looking for a book, any book, I remember I saw one called How to Survive Alien
213680	217920	Abduction, and it wasn't a humor book, it was a serious book with things like block
217920	221680	their mind control and get help from on high.
221680	225440	And so basically, according to the laws of supply and demand, you're more likely to be
225440	228960	abducted by an alien than to have your husband realize he's gay.
228960	231120	That's what that said to me.
231120	238320	And so I left the self-help section despondent and decided that it was time to go to therapy.
238320	241000	Four days now from my high school reunion.
241000	242000	So I went for the first time.
242000	243000	I had never gone to therapy.
243000	246240	I grew up in Oklahoma, which is where my reunion was going to be.
246240	250760	And I went, there was this thing called the Gold Group, because I was in the Writers Guild.
250760	254040	Basically when I became a comedy writer, I decided my husband no longer wanted to be
254080	255080	a straight man.
255080	256080	That was basically what happened there.
256080	258680	And so I was in the Writers Guild.
258680	263840	And they paid for this thing called the Gold Group, and it was a group of therapists in
263840	264840	the valley.
264840	266680	And it was only a $10 copay.
266680	272000	And it's possible you shouldn't skimp on therapy, but I thought I was going to be in for a while.
272000	277660	So I went to the Gold Group, and I remember when I got in there, you basically get what
277660	283100	you copay for because I was in this office waiting for my therapist, and I could hear
283180	284180	the session next to me.
284180	288820	It was this paper-thin wall, and I could hear a man sobbing, and I was like, they're going
288820	290280	to hear me sobbing.
290280	293620	And then when my therapist came in, she turned on this little oscillating fan, which I think
293620	300060	is the system the Gold Group had come up with to deal with the soundproofing problem.
300060	304220	And my therapist, and I didn't have anything to compare against, but I just remember noting
304220	309700	she was very badly dressed, like pink and red together and stripes, and I thought she
310180	311180	can't put together an outfit.
311180	313460	And she has to put together my whole life.
313460	316580	This is not good.
316580	320660	And she had all these questions I hadn't even thought of, like, should you be HIV tested
320660	322780	and maybe he's lying and he's been cheating on you?
322780	326780	And she had a lot of anger that we worked on.
326780	331780	So she felt better.
331780	335020	Okay, so I proceeded.
335060	341420	My decision was to go to the reunion with Sam and pretend everything was fine, because
341420	345780	it seemed better than, well, one problem was Sam wasn't ready to come out, because he hadn't
345780	346780	started.
346780	352380	See, when he told me he thought he might be gay, he said, maybe I'll only be 30% gay,
352380	355320	I'll find out, and then I could still be with you.
355320	358620	And I was overwhelmed at the moment, but I do remember thinking, so he'll sleep with
358620	361340	10 men and enjoy three of them?
361340	364700	I'm confused how we're going to do the math of this.
364860	368460	So he hadn't started that experiment yet.
368460	371080	So he wasn't ready to come out, because he didn't know yet.
371080	373460	So we just went to my reunion like that.
373460	377820	So we stayed with my parents, which is not a fun thing, even when your husband doesn't
377820	379300	think he might be gay.
379300	385300	And I remember at the reunion, I won most successful, and I just was like, yeah, my
385300	386300	husband's gay.
386300	391460	You know, it was Oklahoma, the runner-up was, like, the manager of the footlocker, so it
391460	393180	wasn't a huge honor.
393820	398620	But anyway, I remember when I went home, I was really nervous about my mom, because my
398620	402500	mom, it was like being, you know that scene in My Fair Lady when the linguistic experts
402500	403500	asked her to dance?
403500	407100	That's how it was being alone with my mom with a secret, because my mom, like right
407100	410340	now she would say, your voice sounds a little tight, honey, like she's very eagle-eye about
410340	412140	these emotional things.
412140	416980	And I kept worrying and trying to avoid her, and I completely forgot about my dad.
416980	420460	And at one point, he was sitting there watching ESPN, and he said, is everything okay?
420940	424580	And I said, no, you know, if everything was okay, Sam would be in here watching ESPN with
424580	427100	you instead of in the kitchen flipping through House Beautiful with mom.
429940	433260	And I basically told my dad everything, which is not the system in my house.
433260	434820	You tell my mom, and my mom tells my dad.
434820	436460	But I told my dad.
437500	444700	And then I remembered why I don't ever tell my dad, because he was like, it was like I
444700	448740	was asked, he thought it was as if Sam was asking permission to have an affair and I
448740	449740	should just say no.
449820	453780	So he's, in fact, his words were, I'd like to sleep with Debbie Reynolds, but your mom's
453780	454780	not going to let me.
458980	462380	I was like, but what if you want to sleep with Burt Reynolds?
466980	469420	And to his credit, he had no experience with this.
469420	473660	In college, he had had one, you know, there was one guy in his fraternity that everyone
473660	478100	knew had realized he was gay and left his wife and kids, Jerry Hovelman, and no one
478100	479020	had ever heard from him again.
479020	481740	And that was like his whole experience with the gay population.
481740	483260	So he was no help.
483260	488660	And somehow, though, Sam and I survived our my high school reunion, but Mr.
488660	491140	Kaufman, who lived downstairs, did not survive the weekend.
491340	494660	He had died in a sleep of a heart attack and there was a funeral.
495220	500380	And and I remember it was kind of a highlight for me because I had been crying in such
500380	502580	inappropriate places all week.
502780	507140	And finally, I was at a funeral and I could just sob, even though I think it was odd to
507140	508900	people because they were like, is she the tenant?
508900	516180	Because I was kind of like grabbing Kleenex from the mother.
516180	522980	You know, but I remember I was there with Sam and we were holding hands and we were
522980	527500	thinking I was thinking at least at a funeral, there's a body and a grave and
528300	530180	something tangible to mark the end.
530180	532740	And with the relationship, it's never so clearly marked.
533340	536620	And it was a relief to be there with Sam for closure.
536700	540140	And then it being a Jewish funeral, there was a need for a minion where they needed 10
540140	545060	men to go. And I remember thinking, don't go with the men to Sam.
545060	547940	I do not want him to go with the men.
548500	550540	But then finally, I said go.
550540	553260	And I realized I meant it in the largest sense possible.
553900	561140	And about a week later, my dad called me and he said, you know, it's really 99 percent
561140	562940	genetic, this whole homosexuality thing.
563260	566780	And I was completely thrown and thought maybe he'd been on the Internet and researching.
566780	572100	And it turned out that my dad had called Jerry Hovelman and asked him to lunch.
572580	575300	He had tracked down this man and took him to Denny's.
577020	581380	And I'm sure there were lots of disclaimers because my dad does not take men to lunch.
581380	583220	So he probably was afraid it would sound like a date or something.
583460	588220	And I'm sure when he showed up in shorts and black dress socks and loafers, it was clear
588220	589900	he was not of the gay persuasion.
590900	598220	But he asked Jerry all the things he wanted to ask, I guess, and couldn't like, could
598220	599220	you have avoided this?
599220	600180	And did you ever regret it?
600180	601700	And is your wife OK?
601980	605820	And it was maybe the nicest thing a father ever did, taking Jerry Hovelman to lunch.
606420	609740	And just about a week after that, Sam was finally moving out.
610060	613420	And I remember we were in the top floor of our duplex and downstairs, Mrs.
613420	615500	Kaufman was gardening like she always did.
615780	620700	And Sam hadn't talked to her yet because she was like a parent figure and he still
620700	621980	wasn't ready to come out.
621980	625660	And he wasn't dealing with things as he hadn't dealt with many things.
626420	629540	And so I said, you have to tell her because the moving van is going to be here any
629540	633060	minute and she's going to wonder because and he wouldn't.
633060	634580	So I went downstairs to talk to her.
634580	641140	And I remember she was she'd always loved gardening, but it was really about she seemed
641140	644740	more desperate than ever to kind of keep things alive, nurture the living things and
644740	645940	not to let things slip away.
645940	648820	And she couldn't imagine why I was letting my husband slip away.
648820	650460	And I couldn't explain to her.
651540	656700	And so we just sat together on this bench and shoulder to shoulder to women alone,
656700	660580	but not really alone as the moving van lumbered over to the sidewalk.
661580	661980	Thank you.

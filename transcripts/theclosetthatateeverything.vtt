00:00.000 --> 00:03.700
My mom was a really amazing person.

00:03.700 --> 00:06.700
She was the type of person that could take any mundane life event

00:06.700 --> 00:10.100
and turn it into a party in about 10 minutes flat.

00:10.100 --> 00:14.100
She was really, really into holidays,

00:14.100 --> 00:17.400
and she could take our normal suburban Pittsburgh house

00:17.400 --> 00:20.800
and turn it into all these magical worlds.

00:20.800 --> 00:24.200
And not just for holidays that, like, everybody decorates for.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.900
We had a special set of flags that were just for Memorial Day,

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
that were different than the flags that we used on the 4th of July.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.500
Christmas was a really big deal.

00:34.500 --> 00:40.200
We had a tree in every room, and every tree had a theme.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.300
She liked themes.

00:42.300 --> 00:45.200
I never had a birthday party that didn't have one.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.100
There was the Victorian Tea Party,

00:48.100 --> 00:51.500
and the fitness birthday party.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.600
I'm an only child, what can I say?

00:54.600 --> 00:59.200
I think she just really wanted everything to be special.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.700
But growing up like this,

01:00.700 --> 01:05.600
that also meant that our house had a lot of stuff in it.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.200
If we're being honest, she was a pack rat verging onto a hoarder.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.600
She had all the tendencies.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.200
If she saw something she liked, she bought three of them.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.300
She had all of these materials for projects that she never even started,

01:16.300 --> 01:17.800
let alone finished.

01:17.800 --> 01:22.900
She saved everything, like normal stuff that parents save, like schoolwork,

01:22.900 --> 01:27.000
but then like old bits of wrapping paper and ribbons.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.600
She never threw away a piece of clothes.

01:30.600 --> 01:36.300
She had two closets and two armoires just full of her clothing.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.600
And that was kind of her MO.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.200
Like if you walked into our house,

01:39.200 --> 01:42.500
you would never know that she had all of this stuff,

01:42.500 --> 01:46.900
because it was all tucked away into closets and drawers, nooks, crannies.

01:46.900 --> 01:50.800
The attic was so full that we weren't even allowed to go in it,

01:50.800 --> 01:53.900
and it was all Christmas decorations.

01:53.900 --> 01:57.700
So I, as much as I loved this celebration,

01:57.700 --> 02:00.500
like I could just never wrap my brain around the amount of stuff.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.900
Like even as a child,

02:01.900 --> 02:05.900
I just didn't understand the point of having things that we only used once a year,

02:05.900 --> 02:08.500
or that she would just buy and forget about.

02:08.500 --> 02:12.300
So now I'm someone who compulsively cleans.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.700
When I open my own closet and I see something that I haven't, you know,

02:15.700 --> 02:17.700
looked at or thought about for a couple months,

02:17.700 --> 02:19.600
it like immediately goes to goodwill.

02:19.600 --> 02:23.100
I'm not super sentimental with things.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.400
You know, my husband might get me a card and write a little note in it,

02:26.400 --> 02:32.000
and I'll put it out and then find a way to like quietly get rid of it.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.600
So growing up in this house,

02:36.600 --> 02:40.300
I just, you know, I never could understand all the stuff.

02:40.300 --> 02:44.400
I was just more pragmatic than she ever was.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.900
She was also really sick for my entire life.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.900
We had a lot of holidays in hospitals or when she was bedridden,

02:51.900 --> 02:53.400
but that never really slowed her down.

02:53.400 --> 02:57.900
You know, she always like dragged herself out of bed and got the stuff up.

02:57.900 --> 03:01.500
And when she passed away, when I was 25,

03:01.500 --> 03:05.800
it was sudden, but it wasn't necessarily unexpected.

03:05.800 --> 03:11.000
So while, you know, my dad and I weren't really prepared for it emotionally,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.300
we had had a chance to sort of deal with that mentally.

03:14.300 --> 03:17.100
So that first Christmas after she passed away,

03:17.100 --> 03:19.100
we decided we're going to do the thing, you know.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.400
We tracked down the decorations.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.900
We found as many of them as we could.

03:22.900 --> 03:26.000
We put them all up and we had a whole family over

03:26.000 --> 03:28.700
and I cooked my first turkey all by myself.

03:28.700 --> 03:33.100
And even though she wasn't there and it wasn't quite the same,

03:33.100 --> 03:35.300
it felt okay.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.400
You know, this is the new normal.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.700
We can figure this out.

03:39.700 --> 03:43.800
And about a year after that, I got the phone call from my dad.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.500
I'm going to sell the house.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.000
You know, it's too big.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.900
And I took this a lot harder than your average adult does.

03:51.900 --> 03:55.500
It was the only house that I had ever lived in my entire life

03:55.500 --> 03:58.800
from when I was born until I went away to college.

03:58.800 --> 04:05.800
And I just couldn't imagine a world in where I wasn't going back to that house.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.800
But despite my hesitations, this is what's happening.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.700
So I go home to help him clean out the house

04:10.700 --> 04:13.500
and immediately it is just stuff overwhelm.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.100
I mean, there's 20 years worth of stuff here

04:16.100 --> 04:19.100
that nobody has ever really gone through.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.900
And I live in Brooklyn in an apartment.

04:21.900 --> 04:24.700
What am I going to do with a formal dining room table

04:24.700 --> 04:27.900
and like eight chairs that are so heavy I can barely lift them,

04:27.900 --> 04:31.600
let alone an entire attic full of Christmas decorations?

04:31.600 --> 04:35.500
And it immediately just made me feel like a pretty terrible daughter

04:35.500 --> 04:39.600
because I knew the expectation was that I was supposed to keep all of this stuff,

04:39.600 --> 04:43.000
that somehow one day I was going to have my own house

04:43.000 --> 04:48.200
and I was going to fill it up with the stuff and our lives were just really different.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.200
That was never going to be my thing.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.600
So I'm standing there having this moment in the house

04:54.600 --> 04:56.600
looking at this dining room table and my dad says to me,

04:56.600 --> 05:00.400
you got to go clean out the closet in the bedroom.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.000
In my house for my entire life,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
this specific closet was always called the closet that eats everything.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
And it was called this because if you lost something in my house,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.100
no matter where this item originated from,

05:15.100 --> 05:18.600
it wound up in this closet like that room in Harry Potter

05:18.600 --> 05:20.600
where all the missing stuff goes.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.100
It's like a series of pneumatic tubes like would connect the garage and the kitchen

05:24.100 --> 05:27.400
and no matter where this item originated, it wound up in this closet.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.600
And it would like lose a shirt and I'd be like,

05:29.600 --> 05:31.200
Mom, have you seen my shirt?

05:31.200 --> 05:33.700
Oh, well, did you check the closet that eats everything?

05:33.700 --> 05:36.200
No, Mom, why would it be in there?

05:36.200 --> 05:38.600
And she'd like open the door and pull out the shirt.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.200
Is this the one you're looking for?

05:40.200 --> 05:42.500
Just happened more times that I could count.

05:42.500 --> 05:47.000
But the real reason that I was anxious about going into this closet

05:47.000 --> 05:51.700
was because it was also where we kept all of the family photos

05:51.700 --> 05:55.900
and the scrapbooking materials.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.600
So I made a plan.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.600
I was not going to engage with any of the stuff.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.600
I was just going to sort the stuff

06:02.600 --> 06:08.300
because nostalgia is the enemy of all successful cleaning expeditions.

06:08.300 --> 06:12.400
So family photos, keep one pile.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.900
Old unsent greeting cards, throw away another pile.

06:16.900 --> 06:20.900
And that lasted for about five minutes before I'm knee deep in the family photos

06:20.900 --> 06:22.400
going through every single one of them.

06:22.400 --> 06:27.400
And I'm looking at pictures of us, you know, around that ugly table,

06:27.400 --> 06:31.000
Thanksgiving and a bunch of, you know,

06:31.000 --> 06:34.400
six-year-old girls in puffy dresses having a tea party

06:34.400 --> 06:37.600
and photos of Christmas trees that were so beautiful

06:37.600 --> 06:40.900
that they could have been in magazines.

06:40.900 --> 06:46.500
And all that stuff started to get really real again.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.800
And that is when I noticed this box.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.800
It's just a normal cardboard box that looked kind of new.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.400
So my first thought was like, oh my God,

06:55.400 --> 06:58.400
here's another thing that she bought that she didn't even know that she had.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.500
But I picked it up and the contents inside were like shifting a little bit

07:01.500 --> 07:02.800
and it was heavy.

07:02.800 --> 07:10.400
So I opened it and I look down and it is a box of greeting cards.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.700
Okay, so she got the guy at Hallmark to give her the overstock for some reason,

07:14.700 --> 07:19.500
you know, but then I noticed them and none of them have any envelopes.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
And I thought that was weird.

07:20.500 --> 07:26.800
So I picked up the first card and it was a first birthday card.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.300
It was my first birthday card.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.700
It said 2 Morgan on it.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.100
And when you opened it up, it had slots inside of it

07:34.100 --> 07:37.000
where you're supposed to put pennies from the year that the baby is born

07:37.000 --> 07:41.400
and all of the 1983 pennies were still in there.

07:41.400 --> 07:45.000
So I keep digging through this box and there's more first birthday cards

07:45.000 --> 07:48.200
and there's cards from Christmas and Halloween

07:48.200 --> 07:49.900
because who gives greeting cards on Halloween?

07:49.900 --> 07:52.700
And Thanksgiving and birthdays and Valentine's Day

07:52.700 --> 07:56.400
and cards that I had received just because or because we had a fight

07:56.400 --> 08:00.500
and it dawns on me and it's apparent that this entire box

08:00.500 --> 08:02.900
is every single greeting card that was ever exchanged

08:02.900 --> 08:06.300
between me, my mom and my dad from the time that I was born

08:06.300 --> 08:10.000
up until the fairly recent past.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.800
And I just did not understand this box and it made me really angry

08:15.800 --> 08:18.900
and upset because there was obviously something

08:18.900 --> 08:21.400
that I was supposed to know about this box, something that she knew.

08:21.400 --> 08:25.400
She was saving these things for a reason, but I didn't know what it was

08:25.400 --> 08:27.800
and now all of a sudden here's this box of memories

08:27.800 --> 08:29.700
that I am confronted with.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.000
This is what I was so worried about losing in the house,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.100
but now they're my responsibility.

08:34.100 --> 08:38.000
And before I knew it, my whole body just started sort of reacting without me

08:38.000 --> 08:43.100
and I panicked and I started to throw everything away just ripping things

08:43.100 --> 08:47.100
and throwing them and I am weeping and that's how my dad found me

08:47.100 --> 08:51.200
and he was like in a pile of greeting cards surrounded by stuff.

08:51.200 --> 08:57.800
So I tell him about the box and we start to sort of calmly go through it

08:57.800 --> 09:01.700
and he picks up a card and he looks at it and he says,

09:01.700 --> 09:04.700
I remember getting this birthday card.

09:04.700 --> 09:09.200
I had it on my desk for a while and then I threw it away.

09:09.200 --> 09:13.700
I specifically remember throwing this card away.

09:13.700 --> 09:16.200
So now we have this moment where we're laughing together

09:16.200 --> 09:20.300
at this image of my mom like digging through the trash to save greeting cards

09:20.300 --> 09:28.000
and it just dawned on us that we're never going to know the answer to this mystery,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.200
that she's gone.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.400
And I'm looking through cards and I see cards that I signed my name to

09:35.400 --> 09:39.100
but that I don't remember buying and cards that have my name on them,

09:39.100 --> 09:42.900
but that I don't really remember getting and without her,

09:42.900 --> 09:48.000
without her logic and her magic, they were just stuff.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.800
They were just her stuff.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.000
The box, the cards, they weren't my memories to save.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.700
They were her memories.

09:57.700 --> 10:04.000
And she had just saved so much stuff that none of it was really special anymore,

10:04.000 --> 10:09.500
you know, to me that the most special thing about this box was that

10:09.500 --> 10:13.000
she had cared enough to save it in the first place

10:13.000 --> 10:17.400
and that I got to experience that one more time.

10:17.400 --> 10:22.800
So we each took a few things and ultimately we decided we could let it go.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.900
We could get rid of the rest of them.

10:23.900 --> 10:27.400
We took them to the recycling bin.

10:27.400 --> 10:35.200
And the next day I went back to New York and I never set foot in that house again.

10:35.200 --> 10:39.100
But I had this new sense of calm about the whole thing.

10:39.100 --> 10:46.400
And in the back seat with me on my drive was a box of Christmas ornaments

10:46.400 --> 10:49.300
and a card full of 1983 pennies.

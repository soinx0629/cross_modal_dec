WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.700
grew up in a really small town in Alabama and my sister was and is to this day a

00:05.700 --> 00:11.940
remarkably beautiful woman and I was always really good in school so it fell

00:11.940 --> 00:15.140
into this pattern with my family where people would say things like she's the

00:15.140 --> 00:20.580
beauty you're the brain and among my almost anorexically petite friends

00:20.580 --> 00:24.820
growing up at five foot five a hundred and forty pounds it was universally

00:24.820 --> 00:29.020
acknowledged that I was a fat one the whole thing really started in first

00:29.020 --> 00:33.640
grade I have to say there was a weigh-in in school my best friend Ann Coley who

00:33.640 --> 00:36.420
was going to go on to become the head cheerleader of our high school hopped on

00:36.420 --> 00:41.460
the scale and weighed 45 pounds but when I jumped on the needle cropped it creeped

00:41.460 --> 00:46.460
up to 50 and I looked over and I could see Nan looking at me in horror not just

00:46.460 --> 00:50.140
for me but for herself and she suggested right then and there that go on a diet

00:50.140 --> 00:57.220
and so I did for the next 20 years I would never wear a bathing suit without

00:57.220 --> 01:01.020
putting a t-shirt over it first I would never change at a sleepover party

01:01.020 --> 01:04.260
without getting in the sleeping bag I would never let a lover see me naked

01:04.260 --> 01:09.020
with the lights on and not once did I ever stand in front of my closet to pick

01:09.020 --> 01:13.340
out an outfit with any other intention other than to look as thin as possible

01:13.340 --> 01:18.100
now along the way well-meaning people tried to help but just made things worse

01:18.100 --> 01:25.380
such as my stepmother the Baywatch extra who decided when I was 11 yeah 11 years

01:25.540 --> 01:28.940
old she said to give me a makeover but the result was something like if you put

01:28.940 --> 01:34.100
blue eyeshadow and frosty pink lipstick on a cabbage patch kid it wasn't good

01:34.100 --> 01:39.580
but somehow I managed to get through high school and college and at age 26 I

01:39.580 --> 01:46.260
packed up my baggage and moved to Southern California where surprisingly I

01:46.260 --> 01:51.980
actually got better there was something about like all the just extreme views

01:52.020 --> 01:56.300
people had about their body all the fake everything and the bleach blonde hair

01:56.300 --> 02:01.340
that made me kind of give up I think I kind of I think I kind of threw in the

02:01.340 --> 02:05.460
towel and so I joined a gym down the street because it was cheap and I

02:05.460 --> 02:07.940
discovered that lifting weights could be actually fun because you would get

02:07.940 --> 02:13.220
strong and then with my newfound muscle tone I put on shorts for the first time

02:13.220 --> 02:16.780
ever and went for a hike which led to a run and then when food was no longer the

02:16.780 --> 02:20.940
enemy I started cooking healthy food and after six months I actually lost 20

02:20.940 --> 02:24.420
pounds and one day I was getting dressed to go out and I actually glanced in the

02:24.420 --> 02:28.740
mirror which of course I usually avoided and I realized I almost didn't recognize

02:28.740 --> 02:32.820
myself and I examined myself from head to toe standing there in my bra and

02:32.820 --> 02:37.500
panties and discovered that actually couldn't lose any more weight and I

02:37.500 --> 02:42.220
actually looked pretty darn good now around the same time my boyfriend was

02:42.220 --> 02:45.620
back in Boston and he had decided to produce an independent film and he was

02:45.620 --> 02:48.860
begging me to come back east and produce the film for him but in order to do that

02:48.900 --> 02:52.460
I calculated that I was gonna have to raise $2,000 over the next four months

02:52.460 --> 02:57.900
somehow extra which my $11 an hour temp job really wasn't gonna produce so I

02:57.900 --> 03:01.540
went out and got a copy of the LA Times and as I was perusing the ads for like

03:01.540 --> 03:05.700
you know Chuck E. Cheese night manager and you know evening legal secretary

03:05.700 --> 03:13.420
work I saw an ad that said dancers wanted earn up to $500 a night now you

03:13.420 --> 03:17.380
have to understand I cannot dance I'm somewhat famous I'm my friends for

03:17.380 --> 03:20.140
having tripped over my own feet when I was in college in Boston and actually

03:20.140 --> 03:25.420
knocked myself unconscious on the sidewalk it's true so I ignored it and

03:25.420 --> 03:30.180
went to the other ads but I kept coming back to it like $500 a night so I threw

03:30.180 --> 03:34.180
you on the newspaper and I ran to my room and examined my butt carefully in

03:34.180 --> 03:38.180
the mirror like could it be that my butt was good enough and I picked up the phone

03:38.180 --> 03:41.940
and made an appointment with a woman named Samantha now my best friend Steve

03:41.940 --> 03:46.020
was very against this he said Catherine your newfound self-esteem has been too

03:46.020 --> 03:50.380
long coming and too hard one for you to risk it all because some bitch down at

03:50.380 --> 03:53.220
the strip club doesn't think you're good enough and I knew he was right but I

03:53.220 --> 03:59.820
somehow couldn't stop I just had to see so the next day I put on my sluttiest

03:59.820 --> 04:04.700
outfit and made my hair huge and put on like all the makeup I owned and I went

04:04.700 --> 04:08.600
down and as I walked into the club the most beautiful woman I've ever seen to

04:08.600 --> 04:14.220
this day was pulling herself upside down naked up a pole with grace and I was

04:14.220 --> 04:18.180
like what am I doing but just then I heard someone say you must be Renee now

04:18.180 --> 04:22.900
Renee was a totally insane alcoholic legal secretary that worked with and I

04:22.900 --> 04:27.500
was think I was hoping to channel her so I picked that as my fake name and I said

04:27.500 --> 04:30.580
yes I'm Renee and I thought that there was gonna be all these questions and I

04:30.580 --> 04:34.020
had memorized this detailed like personal history that was all a lie but

04:34.020 --> 04:39.980
she just took one look at me and said when can you start so while I wanted it

04:39.980 --> 04:45.580
in my head I was thinking like no way I was like how about Monday and she said

04:45.580 --> 04:49.580
okay over the weekend I went out and bought a brand new pair of silver

04:49.580 --> 04:52.980
panties and a silver push-up bra and these really amazing silver high heels

04:52.980 --> 04:57.140
and Steve was still trying to talk me out of it he was like Catherine the

04:57.140 --> 05:00.260
smarter the stripper the more they hate stripping what are you gonna do when

05:00.260 --> 05:03.140
some asshole comes up to you and says hey you're pretty hot do you want to give

05:03.140 --> 05:06.180
me a blowjob afterwards in the parking lot you're gonna want to tell him to

05:06.180 --> 05:09.740
fuck off but what you're gonna have to do is go well I'll get fired if I do that

05:09.740 --> 05:13.220
they'll be fantasizing about it the entire time you're on stage I'm on stage

05:13.220 --> 05:17.500
and he said do you think you can do that and I was thinking you know for $500 a

05:17.500 --> 05:27.020
night maybe I can so so so insanely that Monday morning I actually went to work

05:27.020 --> 05:30.700
at my temp job and so at five o'clock I got off and showed up at the club

05:30.700 --> 05:33.700
wearing my tipping outfit which was these very baggy awful black pants a

05:33.700 --> 05:38.060
little sailor top my hair very straight and my glasses and as I walked in I was

05:38.100 --> 05:41.460
told to go over and tell the DJ what my song would be and I walked around I was

05:41.460 --> 05:45.740
like hi I'm the new girl I'll be dancing to Alanis Morissette and he was just

05:45.740 --> 05:49.820
like all right and he says the dressing rooms over there and I looked at the

05:49.820 --> 05:54.180
dressing room and suddenly I realized that behind that dressing room were

05:54.180 --> 05:59.100
probably ten drop-dead gorgeous women and I was like oh my god and so I looked

05:59.100 --> 06:03.380
at the door and I looked at the door of the club and just then I heard hi you

06:03.380 --> 06:07.060
must be the new girl I'm Chloe and that turned into my right was this little

06:07.060 --> 06:10.940
Patricia Arquette sort of knockoff girl and she was wearing stars on one boob

06:10.940 --> 06:14.500
and spangled on the other and one of the 70s styles bikinis with a little silver

06:14.500 --> 06:19.220
skirt and she was adorable she's like I'll show you the way so Chloe grabs me

06:19.220 --> 06:22.780
by the hand drags me off and leads me into the dressing room and I start

06:22.780 --> 06:24.940
getting dressed for the other girls and actually the other girls were pretty

06:24.940 --> 06:28.220
nice and so they explained to me the rules of the club which I hadn't known

06:28.220 --> 06:32.580
before in the first place the first song you did you know in your bra and panties

06:32.580 --> 06:35.180
and little whatever you wore after but the set and they're like the only the

06:35.180 --> 06:39.500
second song is topless and I was like the second song is topless I think I

06:39.500 --> 06:42.060
think the whole time I've been pictured that would just go out on stage and

06:42.060 --> 06:46.220
flip around and let the very end I dropped my bra and run but now you had

06:46.220 --> 06:49.900
to be topless for an entire song and I'm like oh no but I was like okay and like

06:49.900 --> 06:52.900
they're all looking at me I can't back out so like I'm taking off my clothes

06:52.900 --> 06:57.140
and everybody's just naked and so just then I'm the DJ who was just what you

06:57.140 --> 07:02.900
know 300 pound man named Rudy comes into the room and he says and he's like who

07:02.900 --> 07:15.180
girls now the girls are kind of and I didn't even care and and I realized at

07:15.180 --> 07:18.980
the time that maybe I'd gone somewhere that never been before mentally and

07:18.980 --> 07:23.220
maybe I was gonna get through this night so Rudy leaves and I'm starting to go

07:23.220 --> 07:25.660
to the girls go no you can't wear those silver panties you have to wear a G

07:25.660 --> 07:30.540
string and I was like oh no I don't have a G string well bye bye bye but

07:30.580 --> 07:35.340
Janae was this leggy blonde from Texas whose claim to fame was that she's

07:35.340 --> 07:40.740
stripped into her six month of pregnancy Janae says hi I just washed mine here

07:40.740 --> 07:43.620
you can borrow this and she throws it at me I'm like all right so I'm putting a

07:43.620 --> 07:49.220
strange girls G string and I put it on and so the girls um helped me do my hair

07:49.220 --> 07:53.460
and they make a huge and they put on my makeup and like fake eyelashes and all

07:53.460 --> 07:57.220
this stuff and I was ready to go and as I walked out I glanced in the mirror and

07:57.220 --> 08:08.260
I have to say that I looked unbelievable so so so I go out and I go back out to

08:08.260 --> 08:12.100
Rudy and I'm like hi I'm ready for my song and he looks at me and he's like

08:12.100 --> 08:19.980
holy shit box all that was under there and I was like thank you so then Chloe

08:19.980 --> 08:23.900
starts giving me a tour of the club and as what she's doing this this guy comes

08:23.900 --> 08:29.060
up to us on crutches he claims he even shot in a gang fight and he comes up to

08:29.060 --> 08:31.820
me and he goes you're pretty hot you know I'll put you in a music video if

08:31.820 --> 08:36.260
you'll give me a blowjob after the show and I'm like Steve you know and Chloe

08:36.260 --> 08:41.560
says you grabs jumps back and screams fuck you she's a stripper not a goddamn

08:41.560 --> 08:48.020
whore and I was just like nice nice so then I'm so then we walk back out and

08:48.020 --> 08:53.460
and it's horribly the beautiful woman from like the audition day was out on

08:53.500 --> 08:56.420
stage again and she was incredible dancer and she's running around and I'm

08:56.420 --> 09:00.420
just like oh my god but so I couldn't tell Chloe I'm like you know I'm really

09:00.420 --> 09:03.380
a little nervous and she goes no no no you'll have no problem she's like it's

09:03.380 --> 09:06.420
not the best dancers that make all the money it's the girls you can really

09:06.420 --> 09:09.500
connect with the men you can look from guy to guy to guy and make the guy think

09:09.500 --> 09:13.180
that they're only looking at them and it's really not being about a dancer

09:13.180 --> 09:16.060
they just want to see you nude up there but the biggest problem you're gonna

09:16.060 --> 09:20.980
have is that you're gonna get bored no being bored was not something that

09:20.980 --> 09:25.540
occurred to me as it was gonna be a problem she's like no you know you have

09:25.540 --> 09:28.660
a special trick it's called the drop and roll so what you do you know as you go

09:28.660 --> 09:31.620
out there and you sort of like slowly slowly slowly slowly lower and then

09:31.620 --> 09:34.680
slowly slowly slowly roll around she's like the picture you rolling around in

09:34.680 --> 09:38.100
their beds and then slowly slowly slowly slowly stand back up and if you do it

09:38.100 --> 09:43.420
slow enough it could take up like two minutes and I was like great so I go out

09:43.420 --> 09:49.780
and so then Chloe has to do her song and I go and I sit down near the door and I

09:49.820 --> 09:52.540
get a coke to drink because I didn't want to drink alcohol because I had to

09:52.540 --> 09:56.380
drive home like I'm such a nerd and so I sit there and I'm all of a sudden like

09:56.380 --> 09:59.940
it was a really cold night and the wind blew in and I got really cold of course

09:59.940 --> 10:02.900
I hadn't eaten for like three days because I was so nervous you know kind

10:02.900 --> 10:07.060
of like today and so I was like I started to freak out and I looked up and

10:07.060 --> 10:10.900
I was just like what am I doing and so I go over to Chloe who's come off stage

10:10.900 --> 10:15.140
now and she's sitting next to mr. shot and the lead guy like they've made up

10:15.140 --> 10:19.620
now they're friends again and so I go over and I'm like hi you know I was a

10:19.620 --> 10:23.900
you have been so great and thank you so much but I just realized that I can't

10:23.900 --> 10:29.540
dance so I'm gonna go home and practice and I'm gonna come back and Chloe looked

10:29.540 --> 10:34.460
at me right in the eyes and she said if you walk out of that door right now you

10:34.460 --> 10:39.300
will never come back and you'll regret it for the rest of your life and I knew

10:39.300 --> 10:44.260
that she was right and just then mr. shot in the lead guy reaches out like

10:44.260 --> 10:48.020
under the little dress somewhere and grabs my bare ass and he sort of

10:48.020 --> 10:51.340
squeezes it and he slaps me in the ass and he says you know this is the worst

10:51.340 --> 10:54.020
you feel this is the worst thing that's gonna happen to you all night and he

10:54.020 --> 10:58.940
smacks me goes now get up on that stage and I was like all right

10:59.820 --> 11:05.260
and so so I went out on stage and you know it's all went out and I walked over

11:05.260 --> 11:09.140
there was a pole and so I sort of swung around the pole and like Chloe's running

11:09.140 --> 11:13.020
around getting everyone to yell and scream as your very supportive friend and

11:13.020 --> 11:18.180
so like I'm running around and I'm but and then all of a sudden insanely I run

11:18.180 --> 11:23.300
out of things to do and I'm like the drop and roll so I'm like lower lower

11:23.300 --> 11:26.940
lower lower lower lower roll roll roll and as I'm really right I feel something

11:26.940 --> 11:32.420
hit my cheek and I'm like oh my god I'm so bad they're throwing napkins at me

11:32.420 --> 11:38.620
and I turn my head to the right on stage and I opened my eyes and I saw that it

11:38.620 --> 11:44.140
was a dollar bill and I was like and so then I'm like lean back like this and I

11:44.140 --> 11:48.740
see standing above me is mr. shot in the you know gang fight man and he's standing

11:48.740 --> 11:53.500
over me with a roll of ones pulling them off and dropping them down on top of me

11:53.500 --> 11:58.620
and all I could think was I swear to God was what would my ophthalmologist

11:58.620 --> 12:03.980
father back in Alabama think if he could see me right now so um but then like

12:03.980 --> 12:08.860
everyone was throwing money and it was amazing and so I got up and then it came

12:08.860 --> 12:13.100
to finally be the dreaded topless song so I went to the special topless part of

12:13.100 --> 12:19.180
the stage and the song started and I unhooked my bra very slowly and slowly

12:19.180 --> 12:23.060
the strap and slowly the strap and then I let the bra drop to the floor and I

12:23.060 --> 12:28.540
stood there in front of a hundred and fifty people wearing only a g-string the

12:28.540 --> 12:33.860
whole crowd went nuts and I have to say it was one of the most amazing moments

12:33.860 --> 12:48.340
of my entire life no one in that club gave a shit when I made them at SAT no

12:48.340 --> 12:51.420
one cared that was a straight student no one cared that was in the gifted class

12:51.420 --> 12:58.980
when I was eight if they just wanted to see me nude it was so cool I never went

12:58.980 --> 13:05.780
back to the club after that night in the first place security was pretty lax Chloe

13:05.780 --> 13:11.780
kept making like little passing marks okay Chloe Chloe kept making remarks

13:11.780 --> 13:14.660
about how only a few of her friends have been killed by customers which I found

13:14.660 --> 13:19.780
disconcerting but the worst part was at the next day at work walking across the

13:19.780 --> 13:23.260
Sony lot I suddenly was examining every strange man that passed me I was

13:23.260 --> 13:28.140
noticing them and checking them out and I've always been one of the any seem

13:28.140 --> 13:31.900
kind of yucky to me I was sort of it's like every man was suddenly a customer

13:31.900 --> 13:35.060
and I've always known those women that really loves men and I thought if this

13:35.060 --> 13:37.940
is where I'm like after three hours what am I gonna be like after three months or

13:37.940 --> 13:42.180
three years but several good things came out of it in the first place one of the

13:42.180 --> 13:45.060
customers taught me this really cool trick which is the guy is pawing you you

13:45.060 --> 13:48.020
hold his hand because he thinks you're holding his hand but what you're doing

13:48.020 --> 13:53.100
is you're holding his hand off of you this came in super handy the next

13:53.100 --> 14:01.340
summer in my career as a film producer but the best thing of all is that to

14:01.340 --> 14:07.300
this day anytime I'm having a fat day or I've just broken up with someone or I'm

14:07.300 --> 14:11.220
just feeling a little down about myself all I have to do is open the door and

14:11.220 --> 14:15.140
peek into the back of the closet where I still keep those silver high heels and I

14:15.140 --> 14:20.740
know in my heart that everything is gonna be okay thank you

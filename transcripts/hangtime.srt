1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
I've always been an adrenaline junkie.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,360
I love driving fast in my car.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,880
I love zipping through the woods on my snowboard, my skis, and I really love backflipping my

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,040
BMX bike.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,480
What I haven't really experienced was flight.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,240
It was something that I'd always been interested in, but hadn't had a lot of experience with,

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,320
and specifically helicopter flight.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,960
I always thought that was the most awesome craft to pilot, being quick and light and

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,520
nimble, and when I saw an ad in the Westward paper announcing an introductory offer for

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,320
30 minutes of sightseeing and 30 minutes of instructional time, I felt like it was speaking

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,280
directly to me.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,120
So I called them up immediately and set my appointment, and for the next few days I

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,920
was extremely excited for that day.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,000
So when the day came, I got to the office early.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,920
I'm never early, for anything, but I was early on this day, and I'm walking into the office

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,280
and I look over and I see a motorcycle in the shadows, this really cool looking motorcycle,

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,480
and I remember thinking, these are my people.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:24,400
So I go in, I sign my name, I go out with the pilot, we look at the helicopter, we get

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,960
inside, butterflies are going, I am so pumped, it's time, I'm going to fly this thing.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,160
I got my own set of controls, he has his own set of controls, we get our little lap belts

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,160
on, get our headsets on, and then the pilot points over at this fire extinguisher and

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,400
he says, I need you to promise me something, and I'm going to promise you something too.

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,400
If you are on fire, I promise I will put you out.

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,400
So I say back to him, if you are on fire, I promise I will put you out.

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,880
He gives me a high five, we start it up, the main rotor blade starts spinning and we just

26
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,220
lift off the ground, he just takes us right up and it's got a glass floor, I'm looking

27
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,620
at it and it's like jumping my bike but never coming down, we just continue to go up and

28
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,980
up and I am so stoked, we're flying around and you wouldn't believe, just out past the

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,740
dirt roads, it is like an African savanna, a safari, you just see things that you would

30
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,660
never see or realize are just out there past the city.

31
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,020
We get up and I see this herd of deer and it's so beautiful, they're like running because

32
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,900
they hear the helicopter and they're in a big pack and they're looking over their shoulders

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,100
and we're flying above them and I'm just like how cool is this, nobody would ever get to

34
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,140
see this and so then he zips into this little, this empty river bed and then just starts

35
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,380
gunning it through this river bed like 15, 20 feet above the ground and I'm loving it,

36
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,900
there's trees on either side of us and we're just zipping, winding through it and I'm just

37
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,340
like this is so cool, I say to him, dude you need to get an awesome stereo system in this

38
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,380
thing man, you can just rock out and he looks over at me like yeah, yeah, this is good right

39
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,580
and I'm just envisioning this, I'm having this whole fantasy in my head, I'm like I'm

40
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,460
going to get one of these someday, I'm going to have my own helicopter, I'm going to tint

41
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,040
the windows, I'm going to paint it like a dragonfly, I'm going to put a sweet stereo

42
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,060
system in this thing, people are going to be looking up in the air like hey there's

43
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,820
Brian, look at him, so I'm just in this fantasy world, just so stoked, we're just hauling

44
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,340
ass around, I love it and then he comes up out of there and he says alright, play time's

45
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,700
over, business time, time for you to learn a little bit, anybody that's going to be a

46
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,580
real pilot needs to know this, it's an emergency drill, it's an auto rotation, basically I'm

47
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,940
going to cut the power, it's like putting your car into neutral going downhill, main

48
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,500
rotor blade's going to keep spinning but there's going to be a big drop in altitude

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,540
at the beginning, you like Elitch's rides and you know, roller coasters, that kind of

50
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,460
stuff, you got a soft stomach or are you pretty tough, I'm like I'm good with that, I'm cool,

51
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,020
he's okay, okay cool, because if you have a problem just let me know, I'll land and

52
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:29,460
you can hurl, okay cool, bases are covered, let's do this, so sure enough, he kills the

53
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,140
power, woo, we get that like 30 foot drop just instantly in altitude, I feel the upward

54
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:42,140
draft of the air and we just kind of come into like this soft, slow drift and I'm getting

55
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,860
to feel what he's saying you can do if you have an emergency landing situation and then

56
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,340
I start looking at him, he's fidgeting with stuff, he's turning things, he's got a stressed

57
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,620
look on his face, I'm just like, everything alright, he looks at me with wild eyes, it's

58
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:05,700
like this is the real thing man, I can't believe it, I look out, I look down, it's

59
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,340
like a model railroad set, these tiny little trees and my first thought is we're going

60
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:22,820
to die, we are going to die, I signed up for this, I paid money to die, like you've got

61
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,140
to be kidding me, and I'm just watching and we're slowly starting to fall towards the

62
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,820
earth and I cannot believe this is happening, I'm just like this is a bad joke right, like

63
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,940
when's the camera's going to come out and he's going to smile and say, just kidding,

64
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:49,220
but he doesn't, he's just doing like S turns and figure eights and I'm just thinking, I

65
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,420
never expected that this would be my last day and I start having these crazy thoughts

66
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:01,100
like I put in some pictures to get developed, who's going to ever see those, who's going

67
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:08,860
to get my car, like it's parked down there and I'm just like, I can't believe that this

68
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,500
is the day, we're going to die, there's just no other way around it, you don't walk away

69
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,780
crash and so he starts looking like he may be able to land this thing, we're coming down

70
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:28,020
towards the ground and now my mind starts to shift from we're going to die to we're

71
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,340
going to get really worked, we're going to hit the ground and it's going to suck, I'm

72
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:40,780
going to be laying there with a broken back, it's just like I wear more pads when I'm riding

73
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,620
my bike, I've got a helmet and knee pads and I've got a little lap belt and this little

74
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:51,140
headset and we're in like a glass box, I'm just like, we're definitely going to get worked,

75
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:58,100
so admit it to yourself, the next hour is going to really suck, you know, and so here

76
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,700
we go, we're coming in for a landing, we're coming in about a 10, 12 degree angle, he's

77
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,900
doing good, he's got us going about 50 miles an hour straight towards the ground and he

78
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,780
just yells to me, he's like, we're going to hit and I just did the only thing I thought

79
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,780
seemed right, I just shut my eyes, I took a deep breath, I put my arms out in front

80
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:23,060
of my face and sure enough, we hit the ground and we just four by four across the prairie,

81
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:30,500
just like, you know, bouncing across the gopher holes and then the left skid digs into the

82
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,260
ground and it makes us stop instantly and we just jerk forward and then the main rotor

83
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:42,420
blade is just going super fast, it hits the ground and it just cartwheels the whole helicopter

84
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:48,220
and it smashes and breaks it right off behind our heads and we come to a stop looking at

85
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:55,060
the sky and there's just smoke and I can smell jet fuel and the flight manuals are all scattered

86
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:01,020
around inside the cockpit and I just shoulder the door and jump out and my feet touch the

87
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:07,100
ground and I just can't believe it, I'm just like, yes! And I look up and I'm just like,

88
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,660
oh my god, we were just up that high and now we're here and I have just like a tiny cut

89
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:20,540
on my pinky and I'm just astounded that this has just happened and then I look at the pilot

90
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:26,300
and he comes around the corner from his side and he's just like, I am so sorry, dude, I

91
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:34,860
am so sorry and I'm just like, thank you, you did it, you landed it and he's like, I'm so sorry,

92
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:42,780
Brian and I'm like, thank you and it goes on and on like this and I'm just, I'm beside myself,

93
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,260
I cannot believe it, I'm like, I'm fine and then he just, he turns into a stress case,

94
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,740
his hands are, his head's in his hands, he's just like, oh my god, I am so dead,

95
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,900
he's gonna have to make a full investigation, there's a $9,000 deductible, we just rebuilt

96
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:07,780
the thing, we gotta go find help, let's go, so off we go, we just go walking across the

97
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:16,740
prairie and I'm just like, a pie in the sky, just like, oh wow, this is crazy, wait till I tell my

98
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:27,300
friends about this one and he's stressed the whole walk and then we see a truck come rumbling down

99
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:34,620
the dirt road, we're like, hey, we wave down this truck, we hop over the fence, we flag these guys

100
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,140
down, they've got a CB in their truck, they call the paramedics, the cops, literally within minutes,

101
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:48,220
it's like every single emergency vehicle within a tri-state region is coming over the hill,

102
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,820
ambulances, fire trucks, cops, four-wheelers, everybody wants to see what's going on, a

103
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:01,940
helicopter crash and people lived, what? So it's crazy, you know, the paramedics insist that I'm

104
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,300
in shock and I'm injured, I had to have gotten hurt, I'm just not feeling it yet, even though

105
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,780
I've walked miles to get here, I'm like, I'm fine, I crash on a regular basis on my bike,

106
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,540
I'm good, I know when I'm hurt, but they insist on taking me to the hospital and checking me out

107
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,540
and giving me an IV of saline and so I'm laying there and I get interviewed by the news and my

108
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:32,260
phone is blowing up and it's just an insane day and I can't believe it, I'm like, it's a dream,

109
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:40,260
I just go home and I'm just like, what? And I'm laying in bed that night and I just, I'm laying

110
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:48,340
on my back, my head's on my pillow and I shut my eyes and I still feel like I'm falling, I still

111
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:55,780
feel like I'm slowly drifting to the earth and I'm like, you know, I think I'm gonna still live

112
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:01,660
boldly, I'm gonna still go fast in my car, I'm gonna still jump my bike and do crazy stuff,

113
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:08,060
but I don't think I need to learn how to fly a helicopter. Thank you.

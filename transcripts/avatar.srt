00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Tom Waits loved the novel J.T. Leroy had written called Sarah. He wanted to do an

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:26,920
interview with J.T. Leroy for Vanity Fair magazine and he wanted J.T.'s input on who

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:37,440
would photograph the spread because J.T. Leroy was notoriously shy. One of the reasons why

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:49,800
J.T. was so shy was because J.T. didn't have a body. J.T. was an avatar. So let me take you

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:01:00,000
back some years. I was 16, 17 years old and I was awarded the state in a group home in

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,200
New York City. Eight girls, one bathroom. And the girls had all had stories being some had

7
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:23,240
been raped, stabbed by a parent, sold into slavery. Everyone had secrets. At night time,

8
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:31,240
we'd tell our secrets and you couldn't tell. And I was the one they would come to and tell

9
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,560
their stories. And if you asked me why I was there, I don't know. All the intakes,

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:50,520
dysfunctional family, I dropped out of school, I don't know. But I was always interested in

11
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,040
how do you tell? And there was this movie, Streetwise, it was a documentary by Mariel and Mark

12
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:06,360
about homeless kids in Seattle. And I gathered up some of my friends, my best friend Lauren from

13
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,640
the group home. We'd been institutionalized together prior to the group home. And we went

14
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:25,760
and saw this movie. And we saw ourselves on the screen. Now the street can seduce you. And these

15
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:36,040
kids were getting swallowed. And we knew we were just one step removed. And when we left the movie,

16
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,120
I saw how people looked at us right before they were kind of scared of us. And I got off on that,

17
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,160
you know, because we'd street all over us. But after the movie, they looked at us with this kind

18
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:58,960
of curious compassion. And suddenly, I didn't want to be the victim in the movie. I was interested

19
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,840
in how do you make that bridge so people suddenly care and curious enough to maybe

20
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:15,920
care? How do you do that? And in the group home, everyone's telling their stories. And I don't even

21
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,360
know how to tell mine. I don't even have the tools to tell mine. And I would go to buy a little relief

22
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:31,040
to a street corner. There's a phone booth right on the corner. And I would remove it from me. I'd be

23
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,240
a boy. And I'd call hotlines. And I'd tell them all the stories, my story, my pain, everyone's

24
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,160
stories, the houseparent who survived the Biafran Wars, and say to me, Laura, your job is to tell

25
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,840
our stories. Because in the group home, my job was I was the translator. So some girls having some

26
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,000
problems with the houseparent, they'd come to me and I would translate between what each other was

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:07,120
saying. Again, if you asked me, I don't know. All I knew is if you heard what my story was,

28
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:16,880
my deepest belief was that you would say, well, you deserve it. You're disgusting. You're horrible.

29
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:27,120
My deepest hope was that you wouldn't. But I never ever gave you the chance. But I wanted to learn the

30
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:35,400
tools to tell because that's the bridge. And I won a scholarship to the New School for Social Research.

31
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,000
And they let me in without the SATs. I said, I can't take the SATs. My last grade of completion is

32
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:52,320
six. And they let me in with an essay. I'm taking every writing class I can get my hands on. And I

33
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,840
wrote this piece in this class about, you can tell a kid that's not going to survive long on the street

34
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,840
because the scars run this way. And the kids are there wrapped in wrapped, you know. And everyone's

35
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:15,080
looking to see whose exterior matches the story. And everyone's looking at this one cool guy. He's

36
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:22,200
all raggedy. And I'm in the group home. And I'm just looking. I'm looking at him too. And I want it to be

37
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,880
him because he matches the voice. And I don't want them to know it's me because it's going to ruin it.

38
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,000
I want it to be him. And then when they leave, because they don't know it was anonymous reading

39
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,640
the story. And then when we leave, I hear people talking about, wow, I never thought of it that way.

40
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:49,800
I didn't know that about the scene. And I'm like, that's what I want. How do you get people to see

41
00:05:49,800 --> 00:06:02,400
what they never saw before? They never knew before. I keep writing, but never as myself. The writing

42
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:18,880
gives me a little more relief. I start writing under the name Jeremy, which becomes JT. For me,

43
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,240
I buy myself another day every time I can find a way to tell, but as long

44
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:37,120
as it's not coming from me, never as a woman. So when I get asked by Tom Waits,

45
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,440
when he asked JT Leroy who he wants to photograph, Mary Ellen Mark, my sister-in-law came over one day

46
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:53,280
and she just shaved her head. And I'm looking at her and she looks like the blonde hair, blue-eyed

47
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,600
little boys that I would see in the after school specials when they were just starting to talk

48
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:05,920
about abuse, sexual abuse. Always a blonde hair, blue-eyed cute little boy that you would forgive

49
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:12,800
and love no matter what they did, no matter how transgressive and bad they were. You just love them.

50
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:26,240
I never saw myself represented in any of that. So she looked. She was JT. And she agreed to be my

51
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,600
avatar. Now, Mary Ellen Mark said that the person she was photographing did not feel like somebody

52
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,560
who had suffered, like someone. It felt like someone who maybe came from privilege, but she said the

53
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:50,640
books needed to be in the world, that the book showed a world she had never seen, that she wanted

54
00:07:50,640 --> 00:08:04,400
the books to be out there. And she photographed the avatar. I continued to publish under the name JT

55
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:17,840
Leroy. I wrote the book Sarah, which was received with great acclaim. I published it as fiction,

56
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:32,800
all my work as fiction. Came to pass that this book that explored the wilds of West Virginia,

57
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,360
a state I had never been in, in this kind of magical, I play with gender and identity and

58
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:47,680
it's the spirit, everything that I had experienced, all the pain, all the suffering, the joy, the hope,

59
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,000
holding on to finding that a possibility of being saved no matter what, the spirit,

60
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:04,400
the humor, it was all in there turned upside down. In this book, Sarah came to pass that I am revealed

61
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:16,240
as JT Leroy. The articulation in the New York Times is hoax, perpetrator, culprit, the jig is up,

62
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:26,880
come clean, liar, fake fiction writer. No, New York Times, fake fiction writer.

63
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,440
Oscar Wilde said, give a man a mask and he'll tell you the truth.

64
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,880
I received death threats, hate mail, was blacklisted, sued in federal f*****g court.

65
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,440
People didn't understand why I wouldn't apologize. She won't apologize. I wouldn't,

66
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,440
how could you apologize for what kept, it kept me alive? I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it.

67
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,040
It kept me alive. I couldn't do it another way. I knew no other way.

68
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,160
Slowly the fan mail came back. I would get letters where people would talk about what the work meant

69
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,640
to it, how it transformed them, how it saved their lives, how it allowed them to see a world

70
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:35,840
that they had never seen before. I got invited to speak, welcome back into the community of artists,

71
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:44,400
to speak all over the world. In spring, I did a sold out reading at Foyles in London

72
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,480
and I'm signing books as me

73
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,400
and these collectors are there and, you know, I'm signing books where, editions in languages

74
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:06,400
that I didn't even know existed and sign this, sign this, sign this and I'm leaving my body

75
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,360
and all of a sudden the crowds kind of part

76
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,480
and this girl comes walking towards me. She's big and she's got cuts all over her arms.

77
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,480
She's carrying a bag and I know what's coming. It's what I've been preparing for my whole life.

78
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,120
She reaches in her bag and I know she's going to stab me

79
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:47,040
and she takes out a book and she tells me that she came to my work after the reveal.

80
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,400
She asks me to sign her diary.

81
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,040
She asks me to sign her diary.

82
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:14,400
I realize that everything that had happened up to that moment had prepared me for this

83
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,000
and I got up

84
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,600
and I held her.

85
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Thank you.

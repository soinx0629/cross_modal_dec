1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
My mom was a really amazing person.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,700
She was the type of person that could take any mundane life event

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,100
and turn it into a party in about 10 minutes flat.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,100
She was really, really into holidays,

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,400
and she could take our normal suburban Pittsburgh house

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,800
and turn it into all these magical worlds.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,200
And not just for holidays that, like, everybody decorates for.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,900
We had a special set of flags that were just for Memorial Day,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that were different than the flags that we used on the 4th of July.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
Christmas was a really big deal.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,200
We had a tree in every room, and every tree had a theme.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,300
She liked themes.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,200
I never had a birthday party that didn't have one.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,100
There was the Victorian Tea Party,

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,500
and the fitness birthday party.

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,600
I'm an only child, what can I say?

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,200
I think she just really wanted everything to be special.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,700
But growing up like this,

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,600
that also meant that our house had a lot of stuff in it.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,200
If we're being honest, she was a pack rat verging onto a hoarder.

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,600
She had all the tendencies.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,200
If she saw something she liked, she bought three of them.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,300
She had all of these materials for projects that she never even started,

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,800
let alone finished.

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,900
She saved everything, like normal stuff that parents save, like schoolwork,

26
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,000
but then like old bits of wrapping paper and ribbons.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,600
She never threw away a piece of clothes.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,300
She had two closets and two armoires just full of her clothing.

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,600
And that was kind of her MO.

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
Like if you walked into our house,

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,500
you would never know that she had all of this stuff,

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,900
because it was all tucked away into closets and drawers, nooks, crannies.

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,800
The attic was so full that we weren't even allowed to go in it,

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,900
and it was all Christmas decorations.

35
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,700
So I, as much as I loved this celebration,

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,500
like I could just never wrap my brain around the amount of stuff.

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,900
Like even as a child,

38
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,900
I just didn't understand the point of having things that we only used once a year,

39
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,500
or that she would just buy and forget about.

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,300
So now I'm someone who compulsively cleans.

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,700
When I open my own closet and I see something that I haven't, you know,

42
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,700
looked at or thought about for a couple months,

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,600
it like immediately goes to goodwill.

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,100
I'm not super sentimental with things.

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,400
You know, my husband might get me a card and write a little note in it,

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,000
and I'll put it out and then find a way to like quietly get rid of it.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,600
So growing up in this house,

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,300
I just, you know, I never could understand all the stuff.

49
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,400
I was just more pragmatic than she ever was.

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,900
She was also really sick for my entire life.

51
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
We had a lot of holidays in hospitals or when she was bedridden,

52
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,400
but that never really slowed her down.

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,900
You know, she always like dragged herself out of bed and got the stuff up.

54
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,500
And when she passed away, when I was 25,

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,800
it was sudden, but it wasn't necessarily unexpected.

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,000
So while, you know, my dad and I weren't really prepared for it emotionally,

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,300
we had had a chance to sort of deal with that mentally.

58
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,100
So that first Christmas after she passed away,

59
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,100
we decided we're going to do the thing, you know.

60
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,400
We tracked down the decorations.

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,900
We found as many of them as we could.

62
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,000
We put them all up and we had a whole family over

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,700
and I cooked my first turkey all by myself.

64
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,100
And even though she wasn't there and it wasn't quite the same,

65
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,300
it felt okay.

66
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,400
You know, this is the new normal.

67
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,700
We can figure this out.

68
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,800
And about a year after that, I got the phone call from my dad.

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,500
I'm going to sell the house.

70
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,000
You know, it's too big.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,900
And I took this a lot harder than your average adult does.

72
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,500
It was the only house that I had ever lived in my entire life

73
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,800
from when I was born until I went away to college.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,800
And I just couldn't imagine a world in where I wasn't going back to that house.

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
But despite my hesitations, this is what's happening.

76
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,700
So I go home to help him clean out the house

77
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,500
and immediately it is just stuff overwhelm.

78
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,100
I mean, there's 20 years worth of stuff here

79
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,100
that nobody has ever really gone through.

80
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,900
And I live in Brooklyn in an apartment.

81
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,700
What am I going to do with a formal dining room table

82
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,900
and like eight chairs that are so heavy I can barely lift them,

83
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,600
let alone an entire attic full of Christmas decorations?

84
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,500
And it immediately just made me feel like a pretty terrible daughter

85
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,600
because I knew the expectation was that I was supposed to keep all of this stuff,

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,000
that somehow one day I was going to have my own house

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,200
and I was going to fill it up with the stuff and our lives were just really different.

88
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,200
That was never going to be my thing.

89
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,600
So I'm standing there having this moment in the house

90
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
looking at this dining room table and my dad says to me,

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,400
you got to go clean out the closet in the bedroom.

92
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,000
In my house for my entire life,

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
this specific closet was always called the closet that eats everything.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And it was called this because if you lost something in my house,

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,100
no matter where this item originated from,

96
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,600
it wound up in this closet like that room in Harry Potter

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
where all the missing stuff goes.

98
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,100
It's like a series of pneumatic tubes like would connect the garage and the kitchen

99
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,400
and no matter where this item originated, it wound up in this closet.

100
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
And it would like lose a shirt and I'd be like,

101
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
Mom, have you seen my shirt?

102
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,700
Oh, well, did you check the closet that eats everything?

103
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,200
No, Mom, why would it be in there?

104
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,600
And she'd like open the door and pull out the shirt.

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,200
Is this the one you're looking for?

106
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,500
Just happened more times that I could count.

107
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,000
But the real reason that I was anxious about going into this closet

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,700
was because it was also where we kept all of the family photos

109
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,900
and the scrapbooking materials.

110
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,600
So I made a plan.

111
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I was not going to engage with any of the stuff.

112
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I was just going to sort the stuff

113
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,300
because nostalgia is the enemy of all successful cleaning expeditions.

114
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,400
So family photos, keep one pile.

115
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,900
Old unsent greeting cards, throw away another pile.

116
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,900
And that lasted for about five minutes before I'm knee deep in the family photos

117
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,400
going through every single one of them.

118
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,400
And I'm looking at pictures of us, you know, around that ugly table,

119
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,000
Thanksgiving and a bunch of, you know,

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,400
six-year-old girls in puffy dresses having a tea party

121
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,600
and photos of Christmas trees that were so beautiful

122
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,900
that they could have been in magazines.

123
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,500
And all that stuff started to get really real again.

124
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,800
And that is when I noticed this box.

125
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,800
It's just a normal cardboard box that looked kind of new.

126
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,400
So my first thought was like, oh my God,

127
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,400
here's another thing that she bought that she didn't even know that she had.

128
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,500
But I picked it up and the contents inside were like shifting a little bit

129
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,800
and it was heavy.

130
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,400
So I opened it and I look down and it is a box of greeting cards.

131
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,700
Okay, so she got the guy at Hallmark to give her the overstock for some reason,

132
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,500
you know, but then I noticed them and none of them have any envelopes.

133
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
And I thought that was weird.

134
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,800
So I picked up the first card and it was a first birthday card.

135
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,300
It was my first birthday card.

136
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,700
It said 2 Morgan on it.

137
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,100
And when you opened it up, it had slots inside of it

138
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,000
where you're supposed to put pennies from the year that the baby is born

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,400
and all of the 1983 pennies were still in there.

140
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,000
So I keep digging through this box and there's more first birthday cards

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,200
and there's cards from Christmas and Halloween

142
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,900
because who gives greeting cards on Halloween?

143
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,700
And Thanksgiving and birthdays and Valentine's Day

144
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,400
and cards that I had received just because or because we had a fight

145
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,500
and it dawns on me and it's apparent that this entire box

146
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,900
is every single greeting card that was ever exchanged

147
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,300
between me, my mom and my dad from the time that I was born

148
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,000
up until the fairly recent past.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,800
And I just did not understand this box and it made me really angry

150
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,900
and upset because there was obviously something

151
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,400
that I was supposed to know about this box, something that she knew.

152
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,400
She was saving these things for a reason, but I didn't know what it was

153
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,800
and now all of a sudden here's this box of memories

154
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,700
that I am confronted with.

155
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,000
This is what I was so worried about losing in the house,

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,100
but now they're my responsibility.

157
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,000
And before I knew it, my whole body just started sort of reacting without me

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,100
and I panicked and I started to throw everything away just ripping things

159
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,100
and throwing them and I am weeping and that's how my dad found me

160
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,200
and he was like in a pile of greeting cards surrounded by stuff.

161
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,800
So I tell him about the box and we start to sort of calmly go through it

162
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,700
and he picks up a card and he looks at it and he says,

163
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,700
I remember getting this birthday card.

164
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,200
I had it on my desk for a while and then I threw it away.

165
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,700
I specifically remember throwing this card away.

166
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,200
So now we have this moment where we're laughing together

167
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,300
at this image of my mom like digging through the trash to save greeting cards

168
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:28,000
and it just dawned on us that we're never going to know the answer to this mystery,

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,200
that she's gone.

170
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,400
And I'm looking through cards and I see cards that I signed my name to

171
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,100
but that I don't remember buying and cards that have my name on them,

172
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,900
but that I don't really remember getting and without her,

173
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,000
without her logic and her magic, they were just stuff.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,800
They were just her stuff.

175
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,000
The box, the cards, they weren't my memories to save.

176
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,700
They were her memories.

177
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:04,000
And she had just saved so much stuff that none of it was really special anymore,

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,500
you know, to me that the most special thing about this box was that

179
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,000
she had cared enough to save it in the first place

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,400
and that I got to experience that one more time.

181
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,800
So we each took a few things and ultimately we decided we could let it go.

182
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,900
We could get rid of the rest of them.

183
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,400
We took them to the recycling bin.

184
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:35,200
And the next day I went back to New York and I never set foot in that house again.

185
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,100
But I had this new sense of calm about the whole thing.

186
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:46,400
And in the back seat with me on my drive was a box of Christmas ornaments

187
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,300
and a card full of 1983 pennies.

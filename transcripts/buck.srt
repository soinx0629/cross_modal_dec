1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,160
So, as I sit down to eat from this spread that has been given in my honor, I can't help

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,560
but notice the two feelings that I'm having.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,400
One, I'm a little nervous.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,160
Two, I'm very excited because you see, in the morning, I'll be paroling from state prison

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,120
after 26 years.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,400
The spread is given to me, not as like to say, hey, homie, we appreciate you.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,640
No, it was a spread to say, we don't never want to see your ass in here again.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,000
And they broke out the finest of the finest, top ramen, chili in a can, roast beef in

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,480
a can, you know, this top line of stuff, right?

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,520
So, after the spread has been had, it's time for me to give away some property, such as

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,520
my TV, my radio, and some self-help books that help me a lot, so they'll be better utilized

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,800
left behind.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,080
Nine o'clock rolls around, it's lights out.

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,800
You don't have to go to sleep, but you do got to get off the day room floor.

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,400
It's cool about me, I'm leaving in the morning.

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,120
So, I may have gotten like three hours worth of sleep that night.

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,840
I slept ready roll, and that means I slept with my clothes on.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,920
Soon as they call my name, I'm out of there.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
Bye, see you later.

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:43,280
So 545 rolls around, the night man says, Cyprian D37-875, report to R&R.

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,640
I walked down that corridor for the last time, walked through one gate after another till

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,320
I get to R&R, and that's receiving and release, and I'm on the release end at this point.

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,960
I get to R&R, and there's about seven to six other guys waiting for the same thing.

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,920
They start fingerprinting me, mug shots, and everything, I'm cool, like, time to go.

25
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,760
So they load us onto a van, and we drive through one gate after another gate, till we get to

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,440
the final gate.

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,920
The cop says, all right, everybody off the van, you'll step to the man at the base of

28
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,120
the tower there, and you'll give him some personal information.

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:37,640
So we did, and he gave each man an envelope with $200 in it, better known as gate money.

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,140
We all got back onto the van and drove through that last gate.

31
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,180
We made it around to the visitor's parking lot, and he asks, is there anyone with a ride?

32
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,780
I do.

33
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,140
I was the only one to get off the van.

34
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,060
These other guys, that $200 gate money, they had to spend it on buying their bus tickets,

35
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,140
maybe back to Southern California or even further up north, but I was the lucky one.

36
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,700
My wife was waiting there.

37
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,060
With her camera, I could see her, she was snapping pictures of me like a paparazzi.

38
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,220
I walked briskly towards her, gave her a quick kiss, whispered it in her ear, let's get out

39
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,740
of here before they say we made a mistake.

40
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,380
We got in the car, drove away, I saw a 7-Eleven, I was like, hey babe, pull over, I want to

41
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,020
go in and get something.

42
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,220
So I went in and grabbed a pack of Big Red gum.

43
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,900
I hadn't had chewing gum in 26 years.

44
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,640
Big Red was my favorite.

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:48,640
We got back in the car, drove away, we were on the road for about 30 to 45 minutes.

46
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,680
I spotted a Target.

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,120
I said, hey babe, that's Target, I saw that on the TV, pull over, I want to go in there.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,000
So we did.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,480
The first thing that caught my eye was how big the shopping basket was.

50
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,640
It was bigger than the space that I had to store my personal property while in prison.

51
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,920
I grabbed the basket and went down the aisle grabbing various things such as underwear,

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,440
socks, t-shirt, toothbrush, toothpaste, you name it, I grabbed it.

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,280
Well, that goes at $200 gate money.

54
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:36,040
So back in the car, and my wife says, so what do you want for dinner?

55
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,120
She stumped me with that one.

56
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,040
Because for 26 years, no one had ever asked me, what do I want for dinner?

57
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,760
My dinner came through a 13 by 13 hole in the wall.

58
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,800
You stick your hand in there and pull out a tray and what's ever on there, that's what

59
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,860
you eat.

60
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,640
So she says, I know what to fix.

61
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,560
So she drove, we made it to the grocery store, went into the grocery store.

62
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:11,400
This gigantic store, Berkeley Bowl.

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,340
So I made it to the produce section.

64
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,640
I'm stuck.

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,900
There are so many oranges to choose from.

66
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,600
And the reason I'm stuck just looking at the oranges is because for the past 10 years in

67
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,980
prison, they had taken oranges away from us because they were used to make wine.

68
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,960
So there's like a bumpy orange, a smooth orange, a naval orange.

69
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,040
I even met my first blood orange.

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:55,080
And at the same time, this wave hit me of alone and feeling like, I don't know, a nervous

71
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,680
feeling hit me like I'm the only person in this store who's paroled from a prison today

72
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,000
after 26 years.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,280
I'm a little stuck and a little, ooh.

74
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,960
So I'm looking around and I spot this ink work.

75
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,760
It's not the typical ink work that I see out here now.

76
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Like what color?

77
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,080
No, I know this ink work.

78
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,280
This is prison ink.

79
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,680
He has a prison guard tower on him, a melted clock with time.

80
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
I know that work.

81
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,400
I've seen that many times.

82
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,800
So I walk over to him and I whisper, so what yard did you parole from?

83
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
He said, oh me?

84
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,440
I got, I paroled from Pelican Bay like four months ago.

85
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm like, and they know you got out of prison?

86
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
They know you're on parole?

87
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh yeah, they're not tripping here.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is Berkeley, man.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,120
Nobody's tripping.

90
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:53,920
Well I walked away from him with the understanding that if he can get a job, so can I.

91
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,200
So I met my wife at the checkout.

92
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,360
Once again, there's another stunned moment for me.

93
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,120
There are 12 checkout lines and there's somebody on the other end bagging the groceries.

94
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:15,040
In prison, there was one window, maybe 13 by 13 again, and there was like 300 guys waiting

95
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,680
to get into this one window with their lists.

96
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,480
I didn't have to worry about an alarm going off or anything, no getting down.

97
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,640
We're going to get our groceries and leave out of here.

98
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,960
That was my thought.

99
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,720
Cool.

100
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,320
So we made it through the checkout, went back to the car, got in the car and we're on the

101
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,080
road and we come to a stoplight.

102
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,780
And this homeless guy had a sign that says, anything will help.

103
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,160
So my wife reaches into the cup holder and gets ready to hand him some change.

104
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,640
And all of a sudden he gets a phone call.

105
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,600
And he tells my wife, wait, I got to get this.

106
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:09,000
And my thoughts were like, if he got a cell phone, I got to get one.

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,560
So we drive away and my wife, she just drives real fast, right?

108
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,320
And we make it to the neighborhood just as fast as we got to the store and she pulls

109
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,760
into the neighborhood and she points out the various neighbors house.

110
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,240
This is where Fred and Mike live.

111
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,360
The brewers live here.

112
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,440
And I'm like, OK, and we get to our house.

113
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,880
And she said, and this is us.

114
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,800
We live at the edge of the forest.

115
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,880
Like, cool, cool.

116
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,440
And so we went inside and she gives me the grand tour.

117
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,600
And so she says, well, I'm going to prepare this dinner.

118
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,160
I said, cool.

119
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,360
So she made steak and lobster with small potatoes.

120
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,440
Nothing out of a can, folks.

121
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,720
Nothing out of a packet either.

122
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,040
She made this meal.

123
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,840
We sat down.

124
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,760
We ate.

125
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,360
And I had my first glass of wine with my meal.

126
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,400
I'm not saying I've never had wine before.

127
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,880
I've never had wine with a meal.

128
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,840
This is some grown folks shit, I thought.

129
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,240
Right?

130
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,360
So after the meal was finished, we're cleaning up, washing dishes.

131
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,760
My wife says, you want to get further acclimated?

132
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm like, yeah.

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,520
She said, take out the garbage.

134
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,040
No problem.

135
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,720
I reach down, tie that garbage bag up, throw it over my shoulder,

136
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,280
and out to the front door I go.

137
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,920
When I open up the door, no more than eight feet away from me

138
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,720
was a 10-point buck just standing there, looking at me,

139
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,960
looking at it, staring at me.

140
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,640
Now, had we been on a prison yard,

141
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,320
me and his buck would have had issues.

142
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
Now, I speak a lot of different gangster languages.

143
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,920
I'm fluent in Crip.

144
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
I understand blood.

145
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,280
I even speak a little ese cholo vato loco.

146
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,520
But I don't speak deer.

147
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,080
So I shut the door.

148
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,200
I called out to my wife.

149
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,360
I said, hey, babe, there's somebody here to see you.

150
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
She came to the door, opened it, and saw there was the buck.

151
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,360
She grabbed the trash bag and walked right past it.

152
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,160
I said, damn, she speaks deer.

153
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,960
I said, damn, she speaks deer.

154
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,520
She came back, and we both look out the door

155
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,520
together at this buck who's still standing there,

156
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,240
just looking just majestic as could be.

157
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,000
And my wife says, you don't need to trip him.

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,240
He's just one neighbor coming to welcome you to the neighborhood.

159
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,160
Cool.

160
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,800
I thought, well, the fellas aren't

161
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,000
going to believe this shit when I tell them this.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,440
I met my first deer.

163
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,720
I met my first blood orange.

164
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,400
I had my first glass of wine with my meal.

165
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,400
This is my first day of my new life.

166
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,320

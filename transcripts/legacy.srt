1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,120
So, about a month into my daughter's kindergarten career, beginning of her being in school,

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:22,920
I was informed by her mother that her teacher was concerned about how she was doing in a

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,520
month into kindergarten.

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:36,160
You would think that there's not a whole lot that you need to know how to do, but apparently

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,280
my daughter was giving her teacher calls for concern.

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:50,880
And so, at the earliest opportunity, which was the parental observation day around Halloween,

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:01:01,280
I went in to observe the class and it was all very familiar and it was clear to me what

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,840
her teacher meant, even though it had been delivered to me in a really ambiguous and

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,160
hard to understand way.

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:17,520
I watched my daughter just be herself in this classroom, kind of blissfully unaware of what

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,800
was expected of her.

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,440
It seems all very innocent kindergarten and everything, but that's where they start training

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:33,600
you how to be a part of society, which if you're into that kind of thing, that's awesome.

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:45,200
But, you don't have much choice in this world, but so I'm watching her and watching her like

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,560
do her thing and watching her teacher get frustrated with her to the point of near anger

16
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:59,240
just because she's not jumping to the next thing that's being assigned to her because

17
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,600
they have little sections in the day or in the afternoon they have to work on.

18
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,240
It was very familiar.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,280
A nice thing that can happen with having children is that you can see yourself and you can be

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,880
reminded of the progression of your own life through viewing them and I was brought back

21
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,920
to my experience being in kindergarten and I can see myself very clearly in my daughter.

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:35,520
We share a lot of similarities and I remember being handed rudimentary mathematics that

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,200
you're supposed to start in kindergarten and not being interested at all.

24
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,920
So not even bothering because it wasn't clear to me that it was like required.

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:54,480
It was clear to me that she was kind of in the same place and her teacher, besides rubbing

26
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,880
me the wrong way in a lot of ways, clearly didn't understand my daughter.

27
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,520
I didn't want my daughter to stay in that school.

28
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,400
I wanted her out.

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,080
And that could be just...

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,240
It's hard to say when you're dealing with your children because everyone thinks that

31
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:25,640
their children are God's gift to the planet or sane people do, sane people do.

32
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,000
So I wanted her out.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,520
I didn't think it was a good place for her but I didn't think anything was wrong with

34
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,000
her but of course I didn't because I'm her father and it's very difficult to see your

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,080
children clearly because I would like to say because of the incredible amount of love that

36
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,440
you have for them but that's not totally honest because there's something besides the love,

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,920
there's ego involved because there's such reflection of you, you want them to do good,

38
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,920
you want them to be smart, you want them to be beautiful because you're smart and you're

39
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,200
beautiful and you dig it.

40
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,480
Or that's how you want to perceive yourself in this world and you want your children,

41
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,680
your offspring to have that.

42
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,080
That's maybe a little ugly but it's true and I think it's true for most parents.

43
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,920
So I do love my daughter a great deal and I love myself.

44
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:37,880
And I wanted her out of that school and her mother, a very fine woman, brilliant and beautiful,

45
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:44,040
we're partnered in raising her, we're not partnered romantically, didn't want to hear

46
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,040
me that maybe the teacher had the problem because she was beginning a career as a teacher

47
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,320
and she always heard parents talk about how it was a teacher's problem and that they wouldn't

48
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,880
be able to actually see their children and I had no idea how hard it was to be a teacher

49
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,320
with all these kids and blah blah blah.

50
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,720
Not blah blah blah, I'm sure she had points but we really, we're very, very good at disagreeing.

51
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,920
We can disagree very strongly.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,800
I can see myself in my kid and I can see myself sitting at the kindergarten desk that she

53
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
was sitting at.

54
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,760
I can see the similarities and a lot of the similarities come down to an attribute that

55
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:41,680
is slowness, like a real slowness that we share that has been like frustrating to teachers

56
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:55,040
and parents and friends and lovers and roommates and any number of people.

57
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:05,520
For instance, it really can and often does take me an hour to put on my shoes and I can't

58
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,360
tell you where the time goes, it's not like I got distracted and started playing records

59
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,200
or something, like I can sit in the same place putting on my socks and shoes for an hour.

60
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,480
So can my daughter.

61
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:26,880
We can lose weekends just sitting on the toilet and if there's an apartment where I spend

62
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:35,880
time with my daughter, there's only one toilet so that's easy for me to see the similarities.

63
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,920
Thinking about how we see our children and how we see ourselves and our children and

64
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,200
how we want to see ourselves in a positive light, we don't want something to be wrong

65
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,200
with our children.

66
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:57,440
It makes me think about a moment in time when I was 17 years old and I was watching television

67
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:05,600
with my father, episode of Nova, it's like a science program that was on, I think it

68
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,880
was on PBS, I don't know if it still exists.

69
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:20,440
This one was on neuroscience and neuroscience technology and there had a guy getting prepared

70
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:29,400
for a CAT scan and being, receiving a CAT scan and it filled me with this crazy wave

71
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,880
of like deja vu but not just regular deja vu, like deja vu mixed with dread and like sickness

72
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:46,640
to my stomach and it was overwhelming and I couldn't stop thinking about it and wondering

73
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
did I have a CAT scan?

74
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,560
So I turned to my father and asked him if I had a CAT scan.

75
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,360
He said no and fell back asleep and then I couldn't get out of my head and I started

76
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:05,640
remembering more and more this experience of being a little kid and getting a CAT scan.

77
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:12,920
I finally went to my mother, asked her and she didn't want to talk about it and I persisted

78
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:22,120
and she admitted that I had had a CAT scan when I was six years old, something like that

79
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:31,880
and I asked her why I had had a CAT scan and she didn't want to talk about it but she started

80
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:43,280
laughing a little bit, which is weird, from where I was standing, kind of filled with

81
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:53,480
dread and having this repressed memory come up and finally she admitted I had had a CAT

82
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,080
scan and she told me why.

83
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:07,520
She said that I was so slow that they thought that I was retarded and I'd be given a battery

84
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,280
of tests to test my cognitive ability and the tests were inconclusive and they couldn't

85
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:25,400
figure out, the jury's still out, trust me, but the tests were inconclusive so they thought

86
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:33,400
that maybe I just had a brain tumor and so that's why I got the CAT scan.

87
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:42,840
I don't know if you've ever had one but I don't even like giving blood for a blood test.

88
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:49,560
I don't, this is actually, thinking about it right now, probably exactly why I hate

89
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,840
Western medicine entirely and will do anything to stay away from a doctor.

90
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:03,000
With a CAT scan, they have to like take your clothes off if you're little and you don't

91
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,320
want to take your clothes off in a room full of strangers and then they, this is my memory

92
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,520
so I don't know, they inject something into your ankle like an iodine solution and then

93
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:24,480
they lay you on a table and you get slid into a tube that sends whatever rays through your

94
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,880
body to look into your brain to see what's going on.

95
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,960
Totally fucking terrifying.

96
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:43,160
I remembered trying to escape, I remembered screaming until I was hoarse, I remembered

97
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:51,800
my father coming into the room and talking me down and I remember having my clothes put

98
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:59,080
back on and taken to the gift shop and my father bought me a book of animal limericks

99
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:06,200
and rhymes and photographs of the animals, all these animals from North America, black

100
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
hard covered book.

101
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,600
I remembered that book and I had it for childhood but I didn't remember anything about the CAT

102
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,200
scan after I left the hospital because it sucked that bad.

103
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:29,000
My parents loved, loved me, loved their children and that couldn't have been anything but

104
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:39,280
painful and frightening from my father too, you know, the whole situation and so I'm just

105
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,320
thinking about what motivated them to go to that extreme to see what was wrong with me.

106
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:56,040
So it turns out that no brain tumor as a child, just slow, I'm just slow.

107
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,960
I've figured out ways to live my life that it doesn't really matter as far as survival

108
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:15,560
is concerned and actually I've been able to thrive, you know, by degrees and I had to

109
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:23,160
think about that, it's so tempting to sing, so tempting to push it so past the time that

110
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,720
she starts playing and I have to improvise a song on top of it to finish the story.

111
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,600
I won't do that.

112
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,400
Just thinking about not doing that to my child, you know, having the good fortune to have

113
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:49,360
a child that's so much like me that I can take my experiences and help her, at least

114
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,160
in this moment, I don't know what the future holds and I don't know who she's going to

115
00:12:52,160 --> 00:13:03,880
become, you know, but I can use my experience in a way to lessen her potential problems

116
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:11,120
in this world, which is what you ultimately, ultimately, ultimately wish for as a parent.

117
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Her mother went to talk to the teacher a couple weeks later and came back horrified and wanted

118
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:26,560
to, but she's not a violent person, but she wanted our daughter out too.

119
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,520
So we took our daughter out of that school, she's now at a Steiner school, which really

120
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,520
suits her much better and we're both slow.

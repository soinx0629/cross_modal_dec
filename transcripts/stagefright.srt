1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
So it starts in 1989 and it's July and I'm on tour with my band and we're

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,520
touring through Europe and this is a very usual thing I had been touring for

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,560
years and years seven or eight years by that point so it we had just come from

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,920
Israel and we had landed in the UK in England so I had never been to Israel

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,800
before and the first time you go there all the security is a bit daunting you

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,680
know they search you and they search you again and they ask you questions and I

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,760
found it a little scary so even though I really enjoyed my time there I was

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,680
looking forward to coming back to England which was very familiar to me so

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,680
this was we just landed in England we were staying at the Holiday Inn Airport

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:53,360
near Heathrow very glamorous so I wake up that morning and that night I'm going

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,620
to play at the Glastonbury Festival in Glastonbury so we have a journey to go

12
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,020
to and it's probably going to be the biggest audience I'm ever going to face

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,020
where there's supposed to be 75,000 or 80,000 people there and I'm headlining

14
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,540
that night it's a Friday night so I'm the last act on the show and all this is

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,860
okay this is fine I pack my stuff I go downstairs to the to the front desk and

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,340
there's some kind of altercation at the desk and I see my bass player Mikey and

17
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,500
he's looking really unhappy he's looking really pale and he's like I have Puerto

18
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,860
Rico and half Italian so pale is not his usual color so I am concerned about this

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,580
and then I also see my tour manager also looking really upset my manager there's

20
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,180
all this kind of buzzing going on I'm like what's going on so we all knew that

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,940
there had been some girl that had a crush on Mike you know and this happens

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,940
from time to time you know girls fall in love with the guys in the band and I

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,940
try and stay out of it you know and they send things or whatever and I try and lay

24
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,380
down rules you know we don't want random girls on the bus but you can have your

25
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,020
girlfriend or you can have your wife random girls off the bus but I kind of

26
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,100
knew about this random girl because she it started off with little gifts that

27
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,140
were coming backstage from Mike email thought that was really cute and then

28
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:19,820
after that graduated to pictures of herself naked and well whatever so but

29
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,860
then we all became worried because she had actually moved to Queens from London

30
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,500
to be near him when we were not on tour and we all felt that that was going too

31
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,620
far so now it turned out that now we're back in the UK and we are going to play

32
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,980
Glastonbury and she has called him in the middle of the night and made these

33
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,700
threats and said to him that she she and her friend who is a male guy who was

34
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,820
also calling the hotel we're going to shoot him if he went out on stage that

35
00:02:51,820 --> 00:03:02,860
night so I'm like oh god I hate I hate that kind of day because I just want to

36
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,220
be in England where it's just nice you know and it was comfortable and it was

37
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,860
you know and Glastonbury is a festival of hippies basically they have a big

38
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,580
peace sign on the stage so and I'm thinking is this really gonna happen but

39
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,500
my manager feels that we should take it seriously so we call Scotland Yard so

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,940
we're all waiting for Mr. Scotland Yard to show up the detective shows up and he

41
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,580
takes the trip with us on the bus Mike is freaking out everybody's freaking out

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,060
so and I'm like okay so he asks us some questions he finds out some things about

43
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,500
this girl he finds out some things about the other man who was making the calls

44
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,620
and this kind of thing so the tension is kind of building it's a long trip and we

45
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,820
finally get there and we wind our way through this crowd of people and we're

46
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,340
trying to find our way backstage to where the bus is supposed to be and it's

47
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,060
kind of muddy I think it had rained and then it had stopped raining so now

48
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,340
there's all this dust and stuff in the air and as throngs of people and we're

49
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,900
trying to find our way backstage and once we get there I feel that I I need

50
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,580
to go for a walk I need a little privacy and I try and go for a walk I figure

51
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,900
I'll check out some of the booths that are selling tie-dyed things and military

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,700
surplus Mr. Scotland Yard wants to walk with me and I'm like no no it's okay

53
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,460
you know you stay with Mike I'll be fine no miss Vega I feel I really should come

54
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,060
with you no I don't want you to come with me you can stay with Mike I need to

55
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:35,500
go off and he said no so I said okay fine I'll stay here then we were gonna

56
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:42,860
go on stage at about 11 o'clock at about 930 suddenly four or five policemen show

57
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,260
up and they come onto the bus and they want to have a little chat with me and

58
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,740
I'm like why you know Mike will be fine he's gonna perform on the side of the

59
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,020
stage we have two bodyguards for Mike he's gonna perform in a bulletproof vest

60
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,860
he's got the two bodyguards are there one looks like mr. clean and one looks

61
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,700
like GI Joe and they're very handsome guys and they're gonna defend Mike's I'm

62
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,700
like great what's the problem so the policemen sit me down and they said well

63
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,020
we didn't want to tell you this because we were we didn't want to upset you but

64
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,220
your life was also threatened they also said miss Vega if you go out on stage

65
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,580
you will also get it so being that we have tracked down the woman but we

66
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,260
haven't tracked down her accomplice we feel that we need to inform you legally

67
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,180
that you should not do this show tonight we feel that you should not perform on

68
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:37,340
stage tonight so I'm like what are you kidding like this is Friday night I'm

69
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,060
headlining the Glastonbury festival there's like a hundred thousand people

70
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,500
what do you mean I'm not gonna do the show of course I'm gonna do the show you

71
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,380
know the show must go on what are you talking about no one's gonna like shoot

72
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:54,500
me on the Glastonbury stage under the peace sign so and then I'm thinking well

73
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,300
anyway you don't want to know what I was thinking so so I said no no I'm said I

74
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,580
really have to do the show I feel that I really must and my my keyboard player

75
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,580
who's also my boyfriend is looking at me with tears in his eyes and he's like no

76
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,700
no I don't think you should do it I'm like I'm sorry we have to do it how can

77
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,260
we possibly come back to England if we don't do this show you know any crazy

78
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,020
person can call up on the phone and say you know whatever they're gonna say and

79
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,740
then we they everybody would know that we cancelled so they said okay well

80
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,460
you'll have to wear the bulletproof vest as well so I said okay the only one they

81
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,140
had was his and this policeman was about 250 pounds and I'm like half that size

82
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,100
so they put it on me and it's enormous and he strapped me in and they gaffers

83
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,780
tape it closed so I'm like okay and I'm like can I still play the guitar I think

84
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,460
so and then I have a they put a huge denim jacket on over that so no one

85
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,740
sees the bulletproof vest so now I'm all decked out like a turtle like this and

86
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,700
my arms are kind of like this I'm like okay but you know I felt really strongly

87
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,220
that we should we should go on we should risk our lives you know this is rock and

88
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:09,660
roll this is what this is what we do so I remember that moment as I was walking

89
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,340
out on the stage and I see the microphone there and I'm in my denim

90
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,820
jacket and my gaffers tape and my bulletproof vest and things start to

91
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,700
feel like I'm going underwater and as I'm heading for the microphone the

92
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,020
thought suddenly occurs to me that they could shoot me in the head and I'm like

93
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,620
oh I wish I hadn't thought that right now but I not thinking about that anymore

94
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm just heading for the microphone and then I pick up the guitar and I start

95
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,680
singing and the other thing that happened was that now this whole

96
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,840
situation has escalated to the point where there's 20 policemen in front of

97
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,840
the stage there's a hundred thousand people behind them there's people as far

98
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,460
as the eye can see from the stage all the way to the horizon this is like

99
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,720
several villages or something not only that but there's helicopters overhead

100
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,640
and they've decided to train the lights not on the stage which they usually do

101
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,880
but from time to time they swivel the lights onto the audience to search them

102
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,120
to see if they see anyone with a weapon so I'm singing every song feels like

103
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,440
it's taking 20 minutes long small blue thing just seems to go on forever and

104
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,920
I'm looking at every so often they swivel the lights onto the audience and

105
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,740
I'm like you know and I continue to play and every so often I turn around to look

106
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,280
at Mike of course he's not there you know Mike is over there with mr. clean

107
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,360
the GI Joe and there's the his amplifier on the floor so it's like

108
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,720
where's Mike oh there's his amp so blah blah I'm playing it's all going pretty

109
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:51,480
well I'm thinking wow this is great that we're alive and suddenly my keyboard

110
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,000
player approaches me and he says sing Luca and get off stage and I'm like why

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and he goes I can't tell you right now but we have to get off stage by 1230

112
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,040
and I'm like okay and then I start thinking well why do they want me to get

113
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,320
off stage did they find some did they find the weapon did they find the girl

114
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,560
did they find her accomplice maybe I should just get off stage and not sing

115
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,280
Luca Luca was my big hit at that point and it was and I decided no we're gonna

116
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,120
stay we're gonna sing Luca we're gonna entertain everybody I've come to be

117
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,480
entertained we have to do this I sing Luca everybody's cheering I come off

118
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,920
stage it feels like it's going in slow motion and I said what happened did they

119
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,920
find the girl no did they find her accomplice no they find somebody with a

120
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,560
weapon no well why did we have to get off stage at 1230 and then the promoter

121
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,440
of the festival comes over to me and says with Miss Vega we didn't get a

122
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,640
chance to explain this to you before but the festival has a curfew because the

123
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,760
farmers in the next field have the cows and the cows get disturbed if you sing

124
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:03,560
past 1230 and it makes them less productive and that's my story

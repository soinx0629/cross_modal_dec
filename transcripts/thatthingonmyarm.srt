1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
People often ask me how I got the scar on my arm.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And what happened was, when I was 14 years old,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I got really sick and no one could figure out what was wrong with me.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I was very ill and finally, after a week of not getting better,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
my mother took me to the hospital and I, after many tests,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
was finally, days and days later, diagnosed with a hyper allergy,

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
something called Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And once they finally found out what was wrong with me,

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
they treated me for it, but not before I had spent weeks in the hospital,

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
weeks blind and mute, as well as being fed by tubes

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and having to sleep sitting up so that I wouldn't choke on my own saliva.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My mother, in her fashion, moved in to the hospital to be by my bedside

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and slept every night in the hospital to take care of me

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and she wouldn't leave my side.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And finally, when I was released on February 1st,

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I remember it was a Friday, as we were riding home in our car,

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
she said, I've made a promise to God that if God delivers you safely

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
out of the hospital that I would go and I would do a penance

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and I would go to the temple and make an offering to give thanks

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
for delivering my child home safely.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So I know you're really sick, but I'm going to see if your stepdad

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
can drive us on Sunday to the temple.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I just sort of nodded in my very ill way and I said okay.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And on that Sunday, February 3rd, my stepfather and my mother and I

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
drove in our red Ford Mercury car with the black interior

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
to the Hindu temple and I was very ill.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was very, very weak and frail.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And that was long enough ago, I was 14, a long time ago,

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
when they still had the front seat that was a couch seat.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So my mother wedged me in between her and my stepdad

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
because she wanted to take care of me.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was still really sick.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I could barely hold my head up.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I had lost a lot of weight.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I was so weak that she said, you stay in the car, I'll do the offering.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
She went, she did the prayers, she did the flowers, she rang the bell,

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
she got the food and they came back in the car

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and she handed me this squeaky round styrofoam plate

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
with a bunch of yellow rice on it and some vegetable curry or whatever it was.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And off we went back down the highway

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and I remember thinking what a beautiful sunny Sunday it was.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And I was trying desperately to concentrate on this plate of food

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and my mother said, you know, just try and have a couple bites of it.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Just, you know, it's blessed, it's from the puja we did.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And as I was eating this rice, suddenly I heard a loud bang!

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I looked up and I can remember the plate flying

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and yellow rice everywhere like confetti.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And as the rice came down, all I could see

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
was this beautiful blue sky, this crystal clear blue sky.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No clouds, no cars, no road in front of us,

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
no trees, nothing, just endless miraculous blue sky

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and these kind of yellow grains flying all around.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then all of a sudden I heard another thud

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and then I kind of heard...

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And it was us, we were flying and then we were airborne, I realized.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then what stopped our fall was this tree

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and then we kind of went down further down this embankment

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and then finally came to a last thud

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and there was just stillness.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I kind of strained my neck and I could see my mother to my right

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and we were all pinned very closely together

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and my mother had her eyes closed and her mouth open

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and blood was trickling out of the side of her mouth.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And to my left, my stepfather was saying over and over again

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
this mantra of, where are we Vijay?

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What happened Vijay? Weren't we driving Vijay?

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We were at the temple Vijay, Vijay, Vijay, my mother.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And from my mother emanated this profound and nauseating silence.

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And I started to scream at my mother.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I started to say, Mom, are you awake? Are you awake?

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If you're awake, say something, say something, please.

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you're not awake, I love you, Mommy, I love you.

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you are awake, I love you, but please say something.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And in the back of me screaming was this chorus,

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
this non-stop loop of my stepfather,

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
almost like that cliche image or track that the cartoons

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
when a bird or a cartoon character is hit on the head

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and they say, where am I? What's going on?

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That was exactly what he was doing.

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And he just kept repeating this.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And it was all of a sudden I started feeling things.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I started feeling hot and cold and wet and sticky and itchy

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and burning and all I could feel from my mother

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
was this silence emanating from her

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
that kept getting louder and louder, this silence.

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Then I finally heard a man call down to us and say,

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
are you okay? Are you okay?

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I said, yes, we're alive, we're alive.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Please get help. Please, please get help.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And then a bunch of firemen came.

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And I remember hearing the crunch of their boots

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
down the leaves, on the leaves, down the embankment.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And they came and they kind of got, I heard chainsaws.

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I heard a helicopter in the distance approaching.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I heard blow torches.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I would later learn that they had to use these famous things

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
called the jaws of life to cut open the roof

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
of this red Ford Mercury Zephyr.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And so I got taken to the City of Angels

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and my parents got taken somewhere else.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
My arm, because we were pinned so tight,

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
my arm had flown across my mother's chest.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And so my arm was just shattered in many pieces.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And I lay there for hours and hours,

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
not knowing what happened to my parents,

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
not knowing if my parents were okay, if my mother was alive.

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I remember being incredibly uncomfortable

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
in a cold hospital bed with glass everywhere,

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
in every crevice of my body, under my nails, in my hair,

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
in my ears, just shattered glass everywhere.

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I remember, you know, in the emergency room,

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I remember vague bits and pieces of what people said,

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
like, you know, well, I don't think it's worth doing,

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
but, you know, I questioned the mobility of that arm

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
or, well, let's leave it alone.

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And we were home. It took us a long time to heal.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
My stepfather broke his leg,

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
his left leg in four places, his hip in two.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
My mother had to come home

120
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and still have a hospital bed at home for weeks and months.

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And we had one-to-one nursing,

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
24 hours around the clock at home,

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
because, of course, my mother this time could not care for me,

124
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
could not be by my side.

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Indeed, she had her own hospital bed.

126
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But my mother was determined.

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They said that they weren't going to do any surgery on my arm

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
because they thought it wasn't really worth it,

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
that it would probably be dormant,

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
be kind of semi-lame at my side.

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And, you know, I was so young,

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I could learn to do everything with my left hand.

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And so my mother was determined not to let this happen.

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And so she, from her hospital bed at home,

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
ordered me to go to another orthopedist

136
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
whom she had found on the phone through colleagues,

137
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and he said, well, she's so young, we should do it.

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And he decided to do surgery on my arm,

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and I got this very beautiful, thin scratch of a surgery incision,

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and there was a cylindrical metal plate that was put on.

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And as my arm got better, the scar got worse.

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And, you know, I was very awkward to begin with,

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and I was 14, I had all these hormones and feeling off about my body,

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and I knew that the scar on my forearm was looking bad,

145
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and so I knew what was to come with this scar.

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And so, anyway, years go by,

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and I had to have multiple surgeries on the arm

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
every time the arm got more and more better,

149
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
every time the scar got longer and thicker and ropier and darker.

150
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And, you know, I kind of found ways to look normal while hiding it, you know.

151
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And I would go on dates in college,

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and I would have to really think about

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
whether I was going to wear a short-sleeve blouse or a long-sleeve blouse.

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And then I was studying abroad, and I started modeling, of all things.

155
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And, you know, I wasn't a fancy model.

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I used it, I graduated from college,

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and then I really started modeling to pay off my college loans.

158
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I was a fit model, a workaday model.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And then this weird thing happened,

160
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and the agency called me and they said,

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
guess what, Helmut Newton wants to shoot you.

162
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And, you know, I was young, and I was like, who's Helmut Newton?

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
They said, you know, Helmut Newton, the guy, and he's great.

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He does these beautiful, sexy, dangerous, edgy pictures of women,

165
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and he wants to shoot you.

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So, you know, before my agency would, you know,

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
when they were calling around, so they'd get comments like,

168
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you know, yeah, she's kind of pretty, but that scar.

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Those same people were calling, going,

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
can we book the girl with the scar?

171
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's amazing that somebody else, thinking you're cool,

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
can make you think differently of yourself.

173
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And, you know, so all of a sudden I was doing all these runway shows,

174
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
you know, I was like doing Alberta Freddie and Herve Leger,

175
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and all these great, and so my salary went up,

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and, you know, all of a sudden I was the girl with the scar.

177
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So, you know, maybe the scar was this mixed blessing in a way, right?

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Because it paid off my college loans, and, you know,

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
bought me an apartment, paid off my mom's mortgage,

180
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
a lot of cool things, so I thought that was great.

181
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And I was thinking about all of this recently

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
because I found myself on my back in another hospital bed

183
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
staring at another white ceiling.

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I was told that I would probably never have children naturally,

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and that was very upsetting, as many women can understand, and men too.

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And then I got pregnant, which was a real surprise, but a happy one.

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And then I was told it would be a difficult pregnancy,

188
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and then it was a really difficult pregnancy,

189
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and I was ordered on complete bed rest the last trimester of my pregnancy.

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And my mother, in true fashion, moved in with me the next day.

191
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah, it's true.

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And, you know, when your mother moves in with you at 39,

193
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
it's a completely different experience.

194
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But there she was, valiant in her nurturing,

195
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and, you know, it was a very scary last few weeks of the pregnancy.

196
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I wound up going to the hospital more than once before I had the baby,

197
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and one time for five days with a fetal heart monitor and tubes everywhere

198
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and staring at the ceiling and thinking to myself,

199
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
God, please get me out of here.

200
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Please deliver me and my child intact and healthy out of this hospital.

201
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I recently miraculously found myself again with my mother in another car,

202
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
this time going to Flushing Queens to another temple,

203
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
but this time to give thanks for the safety and delivery of my daughter.

204
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you.

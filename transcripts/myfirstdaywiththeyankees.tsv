0	4960	I grew up a huge fan of the New York Yankees, which when I was very small,
4960	8960	involved going to games maybe once a year with my father, my little brother,
8960	14280	watching Reggie Jackson, a little bit older, watching Dave Winfield.
14280	17320	And then when I kind of came into my teens,
17320	20920	Don Mattingly, who was, you know, my absolute favorite player.
20920	25680	And as I went to high school in New York and it was kind of a turning point.
25680	28440	The first time that I went to a Yankee game by myself and I started going to
28440	33000	Yankees by myself and it was in one of these games in the fall of 1991 that I
33000	37920	went up to the stadium and bought a ticket to the bleachers and went and sat
37920	42880	in the bleachers and was watching the game and noticed for the first time
42880	46960	something that I'd been to the stadium so many times before, but I'd never seen
46960	51560	this kid in right field wearing a Yankee uniform who was a bad boy playing catch
51560	53120	with the right fielder.
53120	54920	And I'd never noticed the bad boy before.
54920	57640	And this kid could not play catch for his life.
57640	61000	He was throwing the ball over Jesse Barfield's head, the right fielder.
61000	62200	And he was one hopping him.
62200	66360	And I was like, you know, I'm not a great athlete, but I can play catch at least
66360	67760	at least as well as this kid can.
67760	70240	And I don't understand why he has, you know, that job.
70240	71280	And I couldn't.
71280	75680	So I went home that night and I tore a page out of the program that listed all
75680	77440	the different Yankee executives.
77440	81080	And I wrote a handwritten letter to everyone from Steinbrenner on down to
81080	84240	Stunt Merrill, who was the manager at that point, and basically said, you know,
84240	88040	My name is Matt and I'm 16 years old and I'm a huge fan of the Yankees.
88040	91760	And, you know, I don't know if you can apply for this bad boy position, but if
91760	93440	you can, I really would like an application.
93440	96160	And I'm so excited to hear from you that if I don't hear from you soon, I'm
96160	97760	going to follow up with with a phone call.
97760	101960	So I sent these off and about two weeks went by.
101960	104360	And after, you know, two weeks, I hadn't heard anything.
104360	108360	And so I picked up the phone and this Yankee switchboard number was on the
108360	109880	same list of executives.
109880	111400	And secretary asked for the phone.
111400	112280	Hello, New York Yankees.
112280	113920	And I said, hi, this is Matt McGoff.
113920	117600	And I sent a letter in a couple of weeks ago about applying for a bad boy
117600	119760	position and nobody got back to me.
120560	124480	So she is like, okay, well, I'll take your name down and I'll have somebody
124480	126560	get back to you and took my number down.
126560	128640	And another week goes by and I don't hear anything.
128640	132800	So I pick up the phone again and I call on this woman answers the phone.
132800	133800	Hello, New York Yankees.
133800	135440	And I say, hi, this is Matt.
135440	140040	You know, I sent some letters in about the bad boy position and I called last
140040	142880	week and somebody was supposed to call me back, but, you know, I thought it
142880	145360	was kind of rude that they hadn't.
146520	149280	And so she, you know, she laughed and she asked me, how old were you?
149280	150440	And I said, 16.
150440	153040	She laughed some more and I didn't really understand what she was laughing at.
153040	155640	But, you know, she took down my name again.
155640	158280	She said, you know, I'll, I'll make sure that somebody gets back to you.
158280	162680	So, you know, a few days later, sure enough in the mail, a letter arrived on,
162720	166520	on Yankee letterhead, official letterhead and invited me to come up to the
166520	169520	stadium for an interview with Nick Priory, who's the clubhouse manager.
170160	174200	So I put my jacket and tie on and I don't even think I told any of my friends
174200	178920	about this because it was way, way too weird to explain.
178920	183560	So I went up, took the four train up to the stadium and walked into the, you
183560	187400	know, walked around the stadium and this is October, so they weren't playing in
187400	189720	the world series in October back in 91.
189720	191360	So it was very, very quiet.
191360	195720	And I walked around the stadium and walked into the Yankee lobby and there's
195720	199320	a security guard there and I introduced myself and I say, I'm here for the
199320	203880	batboy interview and he picks up the telephone and he's like, you know, Nick,
203880	208320	some kids here to see you and, you know, okay, so he says, you know, have a seat.
208320	212560	So I sit down in the pinstripe lobby and I'm, you know, passing about 10 minutes
212560	216080	waiting for this guy, Nick, to come up for the first job interview of my life,
216080	217200	for the first job of my life.
217200	220400	And I'm, you know, trying to think of the questions that he might ask me.
220400	224400	And so I'm ready to tell him what my favorite subject is in school and tell
224400	228160	him, you know, why I think the Yankees need a big bat behind Mattingly, you
228200	232000	know, to win the pennant next year and what, you know, Mickey Mantle's batting
232000	235880	average was in 1956 and like all these different questions.
235880	239480	So, you know, I'm kind of passing the time and these double doors burst open and
239480	243480	this guy walks in, obviously, Nick, but he doesn't introduce himself.
243480	248240	He's, you know, could be anywhere from 40 to 80 years of age.
248240	253400	He has this greased back hair and he has a stogie between the two teeth left in
253400	258280	his mouth and a chaw of tobacco possibly also and this wife beater t-shirt and
258280	262600	Yankee shorts and white athletic socks pulled up to his knees and he has shoe
262600	266080	polish, like black sneakers that are obviously shoe polished.
266080	269640	And he just looks at me and says, are your parents going to mind you taking the
269640	271680	train home late at night?
271680	274480	So I say, you know, I take the train to school every day.
274480	275640	I think, I think it'll be fine.
275640	279480	And he just kind of looks at me and finally I say, no, I don't think my parents
279480	281080	will mind me taking the train home late at night.
281080	282840	And he says, we'll come back opening day.
282840	285360	So that was October.
285360	288040	You know, I go home, I think I have the job.
288040	289440	I'm not, not really sure.
289440	295440	And, you know, six months later, opening day in 1993, I show up at 9 a.m.
295440	296720	I put on my jacket and tie.
296720	299040	I walk back to the stadium.
299040	303640	I go back downstairs, you know, through these tunnels and come to this, you know,
303640	307960	big steel door that says Yankee Clubhouse on and I walk inside and it's complete
307960	308760	pandemonium.
308760	314520	And, you know, there's these ballplayers that I'd only seen before on TV or across
314520	316320	rows and rows of stadium seats.
316320	318280	And like they're there in the flesh in front of me.
318280	320480	And Don Mattingly is over, you know, on the right.
320480	324320	And I had a poster of Don Mattingly above my bed, you know, for my whole life.
324320	325760	And he's standing right over there.
325760	329680	And Jimmy Key, the ace of the pitching staff, is over there and all these guys.
329680	333600	And, you know, opening day Yankee Stadium is not just a sports event, it's a news
333600	336400	event. It's the beginning of spring in New York.
336400	338600	And Mayor Dinkins is there with his entourage.
338600	345000	And Mayor Dinkins and Don Mattingly, you know, it's so I'm walking around and just
345000	347840	kind of lost. And I figure, you know, I better go find Nick.
347840	351840	So I walk up to Nick and I say, Nick, what do you, you know, I'm mad.
351840	353240	We met a couple of months ago.
353240	354800	What do you want me to do?
354800	356000	It's my first day of work.
356000	359400	So he says, stay the f out of my way.
359400	365040	So I kind of like shrink back and throw my backpack over on the side and just kind of
365040	366080	wander around in a daze.
366080	370200	And I feel a tap on my shoulder and I turn around and it's Don Mattingly.
370200	373320	And he sticks his hand out and he says, how's it going?
373320	374720	I'm Don Mattingly.
374720	377840	Are you going to be working with us this year?
377840	382040	Which, you know, even at that moment, I never really thought about the experience
382040	384880	in those terms. And he could have said so many other things that wouldn't have been
384880	388000	as cool as that. Like he could have said, you know, are you who are you?
388000	389200	Or are you the new bad boy?
389200	390800	Are you going to be working for us this year?
390800	392400	But he said, you know, I'm Don Mattingly.
392400	393920	Are you going to be working with us this year?
393920	396640	So I said, I know who you are, Mr. Mattingly.
396640	397960	I'm Matt. I'm the new bad boy.
397960	400600	And he's like, great to meet you, Matt.
400600	402960	I have a very big, very big job to ask of you.
402960	406000	I've just unpacked all my bats from spring training.
406000	409880	And I don't know if it was the altitude of the flight from Florida or the humidity
409880	412760	down there or what. But the game starts in about two hours.
412760	415720	And I need you to find me a bat stretcher.
415720	421920	So I say, OK. So I go, I go and find Nick and I go, you know, Nick is busy.
421920	425960	Probably half a dozen ballplayers are like bothering him for double A batteries or,
425960	428720	you know, my hat size is my hat's too small or this or that.
428720	431400	And I go up and I'm like, Nick, I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly.
431400	435840	And he lets loose with a stream of expletives that fell on, I swear,
435840	440040	completely virgin ears like I'd never never heard that type of language
440040	442960	in the movies before or anywhere, let alone directed at me.
442960	447640	So I kind of like rock back on my heels and go and find somebody I can trust.
447640	450840	Like Nick's assistant Rob. And I ask him, you know, I need a bat
450840	454520	stretcher for Don Mattingly. And Nick told me to go f myself.
454520	457960	And I don't know what to do. So he was like, chill out.
457960	460560	You know, I saw Danny Tartable using one in his locker.
460560	464320	So Danny Tartable is the, you know, powerheading right fielder.
464320	467680	I go to his locker and he's getting dressed in his uniform.
467680	471280	And I stand off on the side and he says, you know, how's it going?
471280	473240	And I'm like, fine, I'm mad. I'm the new bat boy.
473240	476680	I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly. And I heard you were just using one.
476680	480440	So he's like, well, I was using one, but I left it in the manager's office.
480440	482720	You should probably go check in there.
483400	484760	So I say thanks.
484760	485800	And he says, see you around.
485800	488680	Then I go into the manager's office and walk in and Buck Showalter,
488680	493480	the manager, is having a press conference with probably like eight or ten reporters.
493480	497480	And I stand off on the side and I'm kind of, you know,
497480	500840	the conversation comes to a standstill basically because there's a 16 year old kid
500840	506280	there in his Easter blazer and jacket and standing in the manager's office
506280	509040	in Yankee Stadium two hours before first pitch on opening day,
509040	511600	looking very lost and very anxious.
511600	515360	And Showalter turns to me and he's like, can I help you?
515360	517280	And I say, I'm mad. I'm the new bat.
517280	521200	I'm really sorry to interrupt, but I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly.
521200	523120	And Danny Tartable says that he left it in here.
523120	527600	So Showalter looks down, like beneath his desk.
527600	531720	And, you know, he's like, well, you know, do you need a right handed one or a left handed one?
533720	536440	So this is the first moment all day that I actually, you know,
536440	539680	this is the first question that I had that I could answer with complete confidence,
539680	542120	because you couldn't have grown up in New York at that time, you know,
542120	545000	without knowing that Mattingly was the best left handed hitter in baseball.
545000	548600	So I say, I need a left handed bat stretcher.
548600	552360	So he's like, well, I think we maybe have a right handed one around here,
552360	554200	but probably not a left handed one.
554200	558320	I'm like, you should try down at the Red Sox Clubhouse and see if they have one.
558320	560920	So I say, OK, thanks.
560920	561920	I'm sorry to interrupt.
561920	565120	I go out. At this point, I'm like sprinting down the hallways,
565200	568160	the tunnels beneath the stands, the first base stands at the stadium.
568160	571280	And I run into the Red Sox Clubhouse and find their equipment manager
571280	572440	and give him like the whole story.
572440	574440	I'm at him. The new bat boy for the Yankees.
574440	578240	And Danny Tartable left his right handed bat stretcher in Buck Showalter's office.
578240	580560	I need a left handed one. And like the game's about to start.
580560	582240	And he's like, calm down.
582240	584600	Like, you know, we don't have one, but we need one.
584600	587280	Like, here's 20 bucks.
587280	591040	Go up to the Sporting Goods store on 161st Street and River Avenue and buy two.
591040	594040	Like buy a left handed one for Mattingly and a right handed one for us.
594040	596960	And then bring me back to change.
596960	598840	So he gives me the 20. I put it in my pocket.
598840	599800	I run upstairs.
599800	602120	You know, at this point, it's like an hour before opening day.
602440	606040	The fans are coming down, like 50,000 fans are coming down from,
606160	609400	you know, the subway in the opposite direction that I'm walking.
609720	612440	I'm the only person in the world who knows that, you know,
612440	614760	if I don't come through on this mission, Mattingly is going to go up there
614760	618160	against Roger Clemens and the Red Sox on opening day Yankee Stadium
618160	620280	with a toothpick in his hand, basically.
621280	626800	So I'm like fighting against the crowd and feeling so much weight on my shoulders.
626800	630240	And I make my way, you know, and I'm about to cross the threshold
630240	633680	of Stan's Sporting Goods when it dawns on me, like I've played
634200	638240	a lot of baseball in my life and I've, you know, been a big fan for a while.
638240	640920	And like, I don't even know what a bad stretcher looks like.
642400	645400	And this moment that I'm like walking into the store,
645400	648080	it dawns on me for the first first time, like, is
649080	651480	is this a joke? Like, could this possibly
652240	653640	could this possibly be a joke?
653640	657400	And if it, you know, but I had so much fear because, like, if it is a joke
657400	661000	and I go back and I tell Don Mattingly, you know, I'm too smart to fall for your,
661000	664720	you know, your BS bat stretcher story and I'm wrong,
664720	668040	I'm going to be back in the bleachers, like before my first game, you know,
668040	669400	and lose my dream job.
669400	673520	So, you know, I take three laps around the stadium, kind of convincing myself,
673520	676360	like, it's got to be a joke, like, it's got to be it's got to be a joke.
676360	679880	And I, you know, I walk back back in, I go down the stairs,
679880	681080	I walk into the clubhouse.
681080	683040	Mattingly winks at me from across the clubhouse.
683040	685720	A couple of other ballplayers laugh.
685720	688480	Mattingly goes three for five that day. Yankees win.
688480	690720	It was my first day in pinstripes.
690720	694360	And, you know, I didn't learn until later on that I was the first kid
694360	698160	in anyone's memory to have gotten the job without having a connection,
698160	700960	without, you know, somebody knowing somebody or my dad knowing somebody
700960	705640	or or whatever, which was, you know, a lesson, a lesson in itself.
705680	710840	And, you know, as intensely naive my pursuit of that job was, you know,
710840	714560	I was probably as naively intense in chasing the bat stretcher.
714560	718600	But, you know, the lesson in the story is, you know, when there's
720520	723880	with a great deal of persistence and a little bit of common sense,
723880	725680	even if the thing you're chasing may not exist,
725680	727920	you can sometimes will it into being. Thank you.
735640	736640	Thank you.

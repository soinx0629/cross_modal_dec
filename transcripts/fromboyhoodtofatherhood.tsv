0	2520	My story is about a number of jobs
2520	5600	that sort of shaped my life and shaped my whole destiny.
5600	7680	And it was a couple of jobs I had
7680	10240	during the ages of 20 to 21.
10240	14200	So the story begins in, yes, I was employed back then.
14200	16800	Okay, I don't know why you laughed, but I'll accept that.
16800	17640	It's a good sign.
17640	18900	Okay, I'm thinking out loud here.
18900	22660	All right, so in 1984, I was a sophomore at Princeton.
22660	24000	You can laugh at that if you like.
24000	26640	All right, so in 1984, I was a sophomore at Princeton.
26640	27800	I wanted to take a year off
27800	30120	because I had a very bad reputation at school.
30120	32400	I was drinking a lot, getting in a lot of trouble,
32400	33760	so I wanted to take a year off.
33760	36360	Also, I had joined the Army to pay for Princeton,
36360	39240	and I was looking at four years of active duty after school
39240	40960	and eight years of reserve duty.
40960	43120	So this was my last chance at freedom,
43120	45880	was after, you know, taking this year off from school.
45880	47600	Later, just for the Harpers crowd,
47600	49600	I did become a conscientious objector,
49600	51320	and so I got out of the military.
51320	54160	And so, and avoided the Gulf War
54160	56840	unlike my fellow ROTC guys, which is a good thing.
56840	58560	All right, so, but this was before I knew
58560	59540	I was getting out of the Army.
59540	61760	This was gonna be my year of freedom.
61760	63720	I needed to make money, though, during this year off,
63720	66120	and a friend of mine, I know it's going to seem absurd,
66120	67900	suggested that I be a model,
67900	69280	and he took some pictures of me.
69280	70840	I know I have rings under my eyes
70840	72800	that go all the way to the back of my skull,
72800	74660	and I have no hair, but at 20,
74660	76780	he had it in his mind that I should be a model.
76780	78280	So he takes some pictures of me,
78280	82020	and I thought I was ugly, but I was vain enough to try it.
82020	83520	I don't know what I was thinking.
83520	86500	So I go, I look up in the Princeton Library,
86500	88820	they had a Manhattan phone book, and I look up modeling,
88820	90460	and I choose a modeling agency,
90460	92340	and I go into New York with these pictures.
92340	93580	This fellow takes them, he says,
93580	94700	can I hold these overnight?
94700	97500	I said yes, and the next morning he calls me,
97500	99940	come into New York, we want to sign you to a contract.
99940	103140	He had sent my pictures to the photographer Bruce Weber,
103140	105700	who does the Abercrombie and Fritch and Vanity Fair,
105700	107520	however you say Abercrombie, whatever,
107520	110460	and that this fellow wanted to photograph me.
110460	112020	So suddenly, with this small agency,
112020	113380	which existed for about a year,
113380	114300	and then there was a scandal
114300	116380	with young female models from Minnesota,
117220	119260	so suddenly I'm a model,
119260	122980	and I'm going off to this Bruce Weber photo shoot,
122980	124520	and I remember we met early in the morning,
124520	126940	a bunch of us, a bunch of male models in a van,
126940	130100	and as we're going off to the Hamptons for this photo shoot,
130100	131700	it was like six a.m., this one guy looks around,
131700	134020	he's from Texas, he goes, hey, we're all blonde.
134020	135420	You know, it just had dawned on him,
135420	137680	sort of, it was kind of interesting.
137680	139220	And so we get out to the Hamptons,
139220	140420	and we're at this farmhouse,
140420	142420	and it was like a scene out of Christopher Isherwood's
142420	144220	The Berlin Stories, all these blonde boys,
144220	146420	about 10 of us, running around doing pushups
146420	147980	so that our muscles would swell,
147980	150100	and in and out of the pool, and a big buffet,
150100	152640	and everything, waiting for the light to change.
152640	155260	And so I get my picture taken by Bruce Weber,
155260	157480	wonderful guy, very talented, obviously,
157480	160000	and he wanted me to drop my shorts,
160000	162380	and I felt embarrassed, I didn't think I could do that,
162380	164360	and so I, anyways, I hid everything,
164360	166260	I wasn't able to expose myself.
166260	167980	So anyways, he took these pictures of me,
167980	171120	and I have one, and I'm going to pass it out
171120	172520	as a sort of gift for you.
172900	177900	I only have 150 of them, so if you're one per table.
180840	183100	But this is the Bruce Weber picture of me.
184680	189680	And I was, anyway, the physique was looking good then,
190200	191200	and you can see I had hair,
191200	192720	it's sort of depressing to look at that now,
192720	194760	I don't know what happened, but anyway,
194760	196800	so I ended up in the Whitney Biennial,
196800	198340	I like to say to my artist friends,
198340	200840	I've been in the biennial, but it was in this picture.
200840	204720	And on the back of this is the thing from my nursery school,
204720	206400	just so you can study that if you like,
206400	209180	so pass those around.
210680	213560	So maybe one per table, since it's only 150,
213560	215080	but so it could get to the back.
215080	217040	All right, so here I am a model,
217040	220400	I got several jobs, but at that photo shoot
220400	222960	at Bruce Weber's farmhouse, I met a very pretty girl,
222960	225580	she was his assistant, and she gave me her phone number.
225580	228840	So about a week later, I'm doing my modeling appointments,
228840	230480	which are called go-sees,
230480	232400	which was made very simple for the models,
232400	234200	it was go-see someone,
234200	237340	and so this is what they called appointments, were go-sees.
237340	239220	So I'm on a day of go-sees,
239220	241640	and I found myself in the West Village,
241640	243600	and right by Cornelia Street,
243600	246440	and I remember that that girl lived on Cornelia Street,
246440	249160	and my high school love was a girl named Cornelia,
249160	251440	and so suddenly it was all fusing in my mind,
251440	255120	so I call her, and I get her roommate,
255120	257140	and I explain that I'm in the neighborhood,
257900	259500	I won't say her name, well, I'll say her name,
259500	260820	because I can't think of a new one,
260820	263620	I said, is Erin home, no, and I'm her roommate,
263620	264960	and I said, oh, I'm right in the neighborhood,
264960	266860	she said, well, if you wanna come up and wait for her,
266860	269540	it was late in the afternoon, she should be home soon.
269540	272340	I go, okay, so I go up to her apartment,
272340	274780	and I meet the roommate, who was about 30 years old,
274780	277540	and very beautiful, and very exotic to me,
277540	281540	I was 20, she was 30, and she offers me a glass of wine,
281540	283820	we end up drinking two bottles of wine,
283820	286620	not only has my life been shaped by jobs,
286620	288620	but also by liquor and sex,
288620	290380	which should appeal to the Glenn Fittich people,
290380	294980	so we drink some wine, we drink like two bottles of wine,
294980	296660	the first girl never comes home,
296660	298820	and I end up making love to the roommate,
298820	300660	which these things happened back then,
300660	304480	and so we're making love, and she was older,
304480	306140	and this was all very intriguing to me,
306140	307580	and at a penultimate moment,
307580	309540	the moment before, an ultimate moment,
309540	313500	I said to her, I said, can I have an ultimate moment,
313500	315220	because I wasn't using a condom,
315220	317460	this was sort of before the whole condom hysteria
317460	319700	and AIDS hysteria, and so everything was more
319700	322940	about birth control, I thought of a bad line earlier,
322940	325680	death control, so this was all about birth control,
325680	329020	and so I said, can I have an ultimate moment,
329020	330640	and she said, of course you can,
330640	332780	in a very sort of condescending way,
332780	335500	which was a bad thing to hear right at a penultimate moment,
335500	338260	because I don't know, it destroyed my confidence
338260	340160	as a young lover, oh, of course you can,
340160	343300	why didn't I know that, and so it wrecked my ultimate moment
343300	345060	a little, some short circuit had happened,
345060	347340	but it happened, and so I thought I learned
347340	349860	a valuable lesson, which is you never ask a woman
349860	351240	if you can have your ultimate moment,
351240	353940	you just go ahead and have it, you don't ask her
353940	355700	unless she tells you beforehand that, you know,
355700	357860	you need to be careful or something,
357860	359740	so I thought this was the valuable lesson
359740	362260	I learned to be a Lothario, never ask,
362260	364540	so I go off to Europe to be a model,
364540	366700	because I've done very well, I ended up being photographed
366700	369440	by this guy named Horst, and I was in bus stop ads
369440	371660	all over New York, and Fernando Sanchez lingerie
371660	373620	and a pair of bikinis or something,
373620	376220	so I go off to Europe to Milan to be a model,
376220	378060	but I travel for about a month and a half,
378060	380780	and I get in a terrible bar fight in Paris, France,
380780	383180	and I get my nose broken, and my lips split,
383180	386260	and my skull, knee, and everything got really beat up,
386260	389220	and I was supposed to report to Milan, Milano, whatever,
389220	391740	five days later, but my nose was all purple,
391740	393580	and I thought, you know what, I wanted to be a writer,
393580	395060	I thought a writer shouldn't be a model,
395060	396560	so I'm not gonna go to Milano,
396560	400220	and that's not a dignified job, so I became a male au pair
400220	403480	in Paris in the Montparnasse neighborhood,
404860	406080	but that was kind of a good job,
406080	407980	because I was right near where Hemingway would hang out
407980	410580	and even pass through the bakery that he used to pass through
410580	413780	to get to Gertrude Stein, and so I had my two little charges,
413780	416260	I think they were like six and three, and it was wonderful,
416260	419140	and I was the only au pair garçon in the whole quarter,
419140	421500	so I was with all these Swedish and German girls,
421500	423140	and it was even better than being a model
423140	425660	and going to Cornelia Street, so I did that
425660	427540	for five or so blissful months,
427540	430140	and then I come back to the States, and it's late spring,
431060	431900	and I go visit some friends at Princeton,
431900	433860	and yet again, I get completely drunk,
433860	435740	and then the next morning, I'm lying on the floor
435740	438820	of my friend's dorm room, and I'm totally drunk
438820	443140	and destroyed and debauched, and I'm lying on a hard floor,
443140	445940	and the school newspaper comes flying underneath the door,
445940	447060	there was like a bit of an inch,
447060	450020	comes flying under the door, and opens up to a page,
450020	453180	to the classifieds, as it sort of wafted across the room,
453180	455100	and it was right in front of me, and I look down,
455100	456620	and there was an advertisement saying,
456620	460000	come spend the summer in New Hampshire at Camp Thoreau,
460840	462480	on an idyllic lake, and I thought, this is what I need,
462480	465080	I need to stop drinking, I'm only 21,
465080	466480	but I'm already wanna stop drinking,
466480	467880	I'm sorry, Glen Fittish people,
467880	471240	and let me go off to New Hampshire to Camp Thoreau,
471240	474000	that's what I need to do, so I go off to Camp Thoreau,
474000	475920	and I got the job because I'd been in au pair,
475920	477160	so I knew how to deal with children,
477160	479120	I'd been a camp counselor during the summers
479120	481400	in New Jersey at a day camp, so I get the job,
481400	484440	I go off to Camp Thoreau, and I'm doing pretty well,
484440	486360	and then a friend of mine sends me Lolita,
486360	487840	which I had never read before,
487840	489720	which is not the best sort of reading material
489720	492720	when there's 12 and 13 year old girls running around,
492720	495600	it completely distracted me in the wrong way,
495600	498600	and so one night I got very drunk as always,
498600	500600	and ate some food, and the whole next day,
500600	501760	I was hungover the whole day,
501760	503520	had a terrible headache into the night,
503520	506440	and I was sort of walking around the camp,
506440	507880	trying to clear my head of this headache
507880	510280	that had lasted all day, and I see a light on
510280	514320	at the art counselor's cabin, and so I go to see her,
514320	518480	and she was 34, and I said, do you have an aspirin,
518480	521240	and she gets me an aspirin, and I had admired her
521240	522840	down by the lake, because I had noticed that
522840	524880	you could see some pubis sticking out from the sides,
524880	527400	and I thought this was a more appropriate target
527400	529640	for my affections than these young girls
529640	533280	and the Nabokov influence, so she gets me an aspirin,
533280	535880	and we're sort of chatting, and right in that moment,
535880	538880	a bat flies right between us, and we both scream,
538880	540800	out in the woods there in New Hampshire,
540800	542880	and I say, well maybe if we, and it's flying around,
542880	544360	I said, maybe if we turn the lights off,
544360	547720	I think bats are blind, but if we turn the lights off,
547760	549960	it'll see, I don't know what my reasoning was,
549960	553280	so I turn the lights off, and we wait,
553280	556040	I turn the lights back on, no bat, and I felt very much,
556040	559880	oh, I really am a woodsman, very much a Camp Thoreau fellow,
559880	562120	and right in that moment of hubris, as always,
562120	565220	the bat flies right between us, like some sort of mad cupid
565220	568600	goes right between us, and I turn the lights off again,
568600	571600	I put my arm around her, and one touch leads to another,
571600	575000	I think Blake has a poem about that, so anyway,
575000	577080	we end up in bed, and I remember the rule
577080	579760	that I had learned the year before with another older woman,
579760	581960	do not ask if you can have an ultimate moment,
581960	583480	just go ahead, and when you're ready,
583480	585320	have your ultimate moment, appropriately,
585320	586680	perhaps after she may have had one,
586680	589400	but I don't know if I knew that at 21.
589400	592200	So I had two ultimate moments that night,
592200	595000	it was quite lovely, but the next day,
595000	596760	it turned out I was terribly ill,
596760	598600	and I ended up having salmonella poisoning,
598600	601100	because I'd been drinking the night before in some bar
601100	602840	and ate something off the floor, who knows what,
602840	605240	but so I had salmonella poisoning,
605280	607120	and I ended up in Dartmouth Hospital,
607120	609360	and the camp year came to an end,
609360	611240	I never made love with the art counselor again,
611240	613820	but we parted amicably, it was very sweet,
613820	617800	and I go back to Princeton, become a conscientious objector,
617800	620200	I stole a novel after senior year,
620200	622040	I moved to New York to work on this novel,
622040	625640	and I get a letter from far away in the United States,
625640	628080	and I open it up, and it turns out,
628080	629840	it's a letter from the art counselor,
629840	634240	and with the letter is a picture of a 15-month-old baby boy
634240	636160	with red hair and blue eyes,
636160	637640	and I'm told that it's my son,
637640	640080	and nine months of pregnancy, 15 months of his life,
640080	641720	it was exactly two years ago,
641720	642800	and I was like, oh my God,
642800	645600	and it looked exactly like I did,
645600	648520	so sure enough, this moment that had begun
648520	651160	on Cornelia Street, and of course you can,
651160	654200	and then being an au pair and getting a camp job
654200	657920	and all this drinking had led to me looking at a child,
657920	662920	and I was 23 now, and so I went to where they lived,
663080	666640	and I became his dad, and it turned out,
666640	668480	all this au pair and counseling
668480	670040	had been wonderful training,
670040	672080	and I don't mean to be sentimental,
672080	673160	but that's why we have the word,
673160	674280	because sometimes it happens,
674280	679280	so I became his dad, and I have to say,
679320	681520	it's the best job I've ever had,
681520	684360	and my son is now 17, and he comes up in two days
684360	685520	to be with me for 10 days,
685520	687000	and I see him about every eight weeks,
687000	688240	and he's a beautiful boy,
688240	690360	and we've had an incredible father-son thing
690360	691880	for 15 years now,
692000	695520	so that's my story, and it all began with these jobs,

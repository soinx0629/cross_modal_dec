00:00.000 --> 00:02.520
My story is about a number of jobs

00:02.520 --> 00:05.600
that sort of shaped my life and shaped my whole destiny.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.680
And it was a couple of jobs I had

00:07.680 --> 00:10.240
during the ages of 20 to 21.

00:10.240 --> 00:14.200
So the story begins in, yes, I was employed back then.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.800
Okay, I don't know why you laughed, but I'll accept that.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.640
It's a good sign.

00:17.640 --> 00:18.900
Okay, I'm thinking out loud here.

00:18.900 --> 00:22.660
All right, so in 1984, I was a sophomore at Princeton.

00:22.660 --> 00:24.000
You can laugh at that if you like.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.640
All right, so in 1984, I was a sophomore at Princeton.

00:26.640 --> 00:27.800
I wanted to take a year off

00:27.800 --> 00:30.120
because I had a very bad reputation at school.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.400
I was drinking a lot, getting in a lot of trouble,

00:32.400 --> 00:33.760
so I wanted to take a year off.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.360
Also, I had joined the Army to pay for Princeton,

00:36.360 --> 00:39.240
and I was looking at four years of active duty after school

00:39.240 --> 00:40.960
and eight years of reserve duty.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.120
So this was my last chance at freedom,

00:43.120 --> 00:45.880
was after, you know, taking this year off from school.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.600
Later, just for the Harpers crowd,

00:47.600 --> 00:49.600
I did become a conscientious objector,

00:49.600 --> 00:51.320
and so I got out of the military.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.160
And so, and avoided the Gulf War

00:54.160 --> 00:56.840
unlike my fellow ROTC guys, which is a good thing.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.560
All right, so, but this was before I knew

00:58.560 --> 00:59.540
I was getting out of the Army.

00:59.540 --> 01:01.760
This was gonna be my year of freedom.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.720
I needed to make money, though, during this year off,

01:03.720 --> 01:06.120
and a friend of mine, I know it's going to seem absurd,

01:06.120 --> 01:07.900
suggested that I be a model,

01:07.900 --> 01:09.280
and he took some pictures of me.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.840
I know I have rings under my eyes

01:10.840 --> 01:12.800
that go all the way to the back of my skull,

01:12.800 --> 01:14.660
and I have no hair, but at 20,

01:14.660 --> 01:16.780
he had it in his mind that I should be a model.

01:16.780 --> 01:18.280
So he takes some pictures of me,

01:18.280 --> 01:22.020
and I thought I was ugly, but I was vain enough to try it.

01:22.020 --> 01:23.520
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.500
So I go, I look up in the Princeton Library,

01:26.500 --> 01:28.820
they had a Manhattan phone book, and I look up modeling,

01:28.820 --> 01:30.460
and I choose a modeling agency,

01:30.460 --> 01:32.340
and I go into New York with these pictures.

01:32.340 --> 01:33.580
This fellow takes them, he says,

01:33.580 --> 01:34.700
can I hold these overnight?

01:34.700 --> 01:37.500
I said yes, and the next morning he calls me,

01:37.500 --> 01:39.940
come into New York, we want to sign you to a contract.

01:39.940 --> 01:43.140
He had sent my pictures to the photographer Bruce Weber,

01:43.140 --> 01:45.700
who does the Abercrombie and Fritch and Vanity Fair,

01:45.700 --> 01:47.520
however you say Abercrombie, whatever,

01:47.520 --> 01:50.460
and that this fellow wanted to photograph me.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.020
So suddenly, with this small agency,

01:52.020 --> 01:53.380
which existed for about a year,

01:53.380 --> 01:54.300
and then there was a scandal

01:54.300 --> 01:56.380
with young female models from Minnesota,

01:57.220 --> 01:59.260
so suddenly I'm a model,

01:59.260 --> 02:02.980
and I'm going off to this Bruce Weber photo shoot,

02:02.980 --> 02:04.520
and I remember we met early in the morning,

02:04.520 --> 02:06.940
a bunch of us, a bunch of male models in a van,

02:06.940 --> 02:10.100
and as we're going off to the Hamptons for this photo shoot,

02:10.100 --> 02:11.700
it was like six a.m., this one guy looks around,

02:11.700 --> 02:14.020
he's from Texas, he goes, hey, we're all blonde.

02:14.020 --> 02:15.420
You know, it just had dawned on him,

02:15.420 --> 02:17.680
sort of, it was kind of interesting.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.220
And so we get out to the Hamptons,

02:19.220 --> 02:20.420
and we're at this farmhouse,

02:20.420 --> 02:22.420
and it was like a scene out of Christopher Isherwood's

02:22.420 --> 02:24.220
The Berlin Stories, all these blonde boys,

02:24.220 --> 02:26.420
about 10 of us, running around doing pushups

02:26.420 --> 02:27.980
so that our muscles would swell,

02:27.980 --> 02:30.100
and in and out of the pool, and a big buffet,

02:30.100 --> 02:32.640
and everything, waiting for the light to change.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.260
And so I get my picture taken by Bruce Weber,

02:35.260 --> 02:37.480
wonderful guy, very talented, obviously,

02:37.480 --> 02:40.000
and he wanted me to drop my shorts,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.380
and I felt embarrassed, I didn't think I could do that,

02:42.380 --> 02:44.360
and so I, anyways, I hid everything,

02:44.360 --> 02:46.260
I wasn't able to expose myself.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.980
So anyways, he took these pictures of me,

02:47.980 --> 02:51.120
and I have one, and I'm going to pass it out

02:51.120 --> 02:52.520
as a sort of gift for you.

02:52.900 --> 02:57.900
I only have 150 of them, so if you're one per table.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.100
But this is the Bruce Weber picture of me.

03:04.680 --> 03:09.680
And I was, anyway, the physique was looking good then,

03:10.200 --> 03:11.200
and you can see I had hair,

03:11.200 --> 03:12.720
it's sort of depressing to look at that now,

03:12.720 --> 03:14.760
I don't know what happened, but anyway,

03:14.760 --> 03:16.800
so I ended up in the Whitney Biennial,

03:16.800 --> 03:18.340
I like to say to my artist friends,

03:18.340 --> 03:20.840
I've been in the biennial, but it was in this picture.

03:20.840 --> 03:24.720
And on the back of this is the thing from my nursery school,

03:24.720 --> 03:26.400
just so you can study that if you like,

03:26.400 --> 03:29.180
so pass those around.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.560
So maybe one per table, since it's only 150,

03:33.560 --> 03:35.080
but so it could get to the back.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.040
All right, so here I am a model,

03:37.040 --> 03:40.400
I got several jobs, but at that photo shoot

03:40.400 --> 03:42.960
at Bruce Weber's farmhouse, I met a very pretty girl,

03:42.960 --> 03:45.580
she was his assistant, and she gave me her phone number.

03:45.580 --> 03:48.840
So about a week later, I'm doing my modeling appointments,

03:48.840 --> 03:50.480
which are called go-sees,

03:50.480 --> 03:52.400
which was made very simple for the models,

03:52.400 --> 03:54.200
it was go-see someone,

03:54.200 --> 03:57.340
and so this is what they called appointments, were go-sees.

03:57.340 --> 03:59.220
So I'm on a day of go-sees,

03:59.220 --> 04:01.640
and I found myself in the West Village,

04:01.640 --> 04:03.600
and right by Cornelia Street,

04:03.600 --> 04:06.440
and I remember that that girl lived on Cornelia Street,

04:06.440 --> 04:09.160
and my high school love was a girl named Cornelia,

04:09.160 --> 04:11.440
and so suddenly it was all fusing in my mind,

04:11.440 --> 04:15.120
so I call her, and I get her roommate,

04:15.120 --> 04:17.140
and I explain that I'm in the neighborhood,

04:17.900 --> 04:19.500
I won't say her name, well, I'll say her name,

04:19.500 --> 04:20.820
because I can't think of a new one,

04:20.820 --> 04:23.620
I said, is Erin home, no, and I'm her roommate,

04:23.620 --> 04:24.960
and I said, oh, I'm right in the neighborhood,

04:24.960 --> 04:26.860
she said, well, if you wanna come up and wait for her,

04:26.860 --> 04:29.540
it was late in the afternoon, she should be home soon.

04:29.540 --> 04:32.340
I go, okay, so I go up to her apartment,

04:32.340 --> 04:34.780
and I meet the roommate, who was about 30 years old,

04:34.780 --> 04:37.540
and very beautiful, and very exotic to me,

04:37.540 --> 04:41.540
I was 20, she was 30, and she offers me a glass of wine,

04:41.540 --> 04:43.820
we end up drinking two bottles of wine,

04:43.820 --> 04:46.620
not only has my life been shaped by jobs,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.620
but also by liquor and sex,

04:48.620 --> 04:50.380
which should appeal to the Glenn Fittich people,

04:50.380 --> 04:54.980
so we drink some wine, we drink like two bottles of wine,

04:54.980 --> 04:56.660
the first girl never comes home,

04:56.660 --> 04:58.820
and I end up making love to the roommate,

04:58.820 --> 05:00.660
which these things happened back then,

05:00.660 --> 05:04.480
and so we're making love, and she was older,

05:04.480 --> 05:06.140
and this was all very intriguing to me,

05:06.140 --> 05:07.580
and at a penultimate moment,

05:07.580 --> 05:09.540
the moment before, an ultimate moment,

05:09.540 --> 05:13.500
I said to her, I said, can I have an ultimate moment,

05:13.500 --> 05:15.220
because I wasn't using a condom,

05:15.220 --> 05:17.460
this was sort of before the whole condom hysteria

05:17.460 --> 05:19.700
and AIDS hysteria, and so everything was more

05:19.700 --> 05:22.940
about birth control, I thought of a bad line earlier,

05:22.940 --> 05:25.680
death control, so this was all about birth control,

05:25.680 --> 05:29.020
and so I said, can I have an ultimate moment,

05:29.020 --> 05:30.640
and she said, of course you can,

05:30.640 --> 05:32.780
in a very sort of condescending way,

05:32.780 --> 05:35.500
which was a bad thing to hear right at a penultimate moment,

05:35.500 --> 05:38.260
because I don't know, it destroyed my confidence

05:38.260 --> 05:40.160
as a young lover, oh, of course you can,

05:40.160 --> 05:43.300
why didn't I know that, and so it wrecked my ultimate moment

05:43.300 --> 05:45.060
a little, some short circuit had happened,

05:45.060 --> 05:47.340
but it happened, and so I thought I learned

05:47.340 --> 05:49.860
a valuable lesson, which is you never ask a woman

05:49.860 --> 05:51.240
if you can have your ultimate moment,

05:51.240 --> 05:53.940
you just go ahead and have it, you don't ask her

05:53.940 --> 05:55.700
unless she tells you beforehand that, you know,

05:55.700 --> 05:57.860
you need to be careful or something,

05:57.860 --> 05:59.740
so I thought this was the valuable lesson

05:59.740 --> 06:02.260
I learned to be a Lothario, never ask,

06:02.260 --> 06:04.540
so I go off to Europe to be a model,

06:04.540 --> 06:06.700
because I've done very well, I ended up being photographed

06:06.700 --> 06:09.440
by this guy named Horst, and I was in bus stop ads

06:09.440 --> 06:11.660
all over New York, and Fernando Sanchez lingerie

06:11.660 --> 06:13.620
and a pair of bikinis or something,

06:13.620 --> 06:16.220
so I go off to Europe to Milan to be a model,

06:16.220 --> 06:18.060
but I travel for about a month and a half,

06:18.060 --> 06:20.780
and I get in a terrible bar fight in Paris, France,

06:20.780 --> 06:23.180
and I get my nose broken, and my lips split,

06:23.180 --> 06:26.260
and my skull, knee, and everything got really beat up,

06:26.260 --> 06:29.220
and I was supposed to report to Milan, Milano, whatever,

06:29.220 --> 06:31.740
five days later, but my nose was all purple,

06:31.740 --> 06:33.580
and I thought, you know what, I wanted to be a writer,

06:33.580 --> 06:35.060
I thought a writer shouldn't be a model,

06:35.060 --> 06:36.560
so I'm not gonna go to Milano,

06:36.560 --> 06:40.220
and that's not a dignified job, so I became a male au pair

06:40.220 --> 06:43.480
in Paris in the Montparnasse neighborhood,

06:44.860 --> 06:46.080
but that was kind of a good job,

06:46.080 --> 06:47.980
because I was right near where Hemingway would hang out

06:47.980 --> 06:50.580
and even pass through the bakery that he used to pass through

06:50.580 --> 06:53.780
to get to Gertrude Stein, and so I had my two little charges,

06:53.780 --> 06:56.260
I think they were like six and three, and it was wonderful,

06:56.260 --> 06:59.140
and I was the only au pair garçon in the whole quarter,

06:59.140 --> 07:01.500
so I was with all these Swedish and German girls,

07:01.500 --> 07:03.140
and it was even better than being a model

07:03.140 --> 07:05.660
and going to Cornelia Street, so I did that

07:05.660 --> 07:07.540
for five or so blissful months,

07:07.540 --> 07:10.140
and then I come back to the States, and it's late spring,

07:11.060 --> 07:11.900
and I go visit some friends at Princeton,

07:11.900 --> 07:13.860
and yet again, I get completely drunk,

07:13.860 --> 07:15.740
and then the next morning, I'm lying on the floor

07:15.740 --> 07:18.820
of my friend's dorm room, and I'm totally drunk

07:18.820 --> 07:23.140
and destroyed and debauched, and I'm lying on a hard floor,

07:23.140 --> 07:25.940
and the school newspaper comes flying underneath the door,

07:25.940 --> 07:27.060
there was like a bit of an inch,

07:27.060 --> 07:30.020
comes flying under the door, and opens up to a page,

07:30.020 --> 07:33.180
to the classifieds, as it sort of wafted across the room,

07:33.180 --> 07:35.100
and it was right in front of me, and I look down,

07:35.100 --> 07:36.620
and there was an advertisement saying,

07:36.620 --> 07:40.000
come spend the summer in New Hampshire at Camp Thoreau,

07:40.840 --> 07:42.480
on an idyllic lake, and I thought, this is what I need,

07:42.480 --> 07:45.080
I need to stop drinking, I'm only 21,

07:45.080 --> 07:46.480
but I'm already wanna stop drinking,

07:46.480 --> 07:47.880
I'm sorry, Glen Fittish people,

07:47.880 --> 07:51.240
and let me go off to New Hampshire to Camp Thoreau,

07:51.240 --> 07:54.000
that's what I need to do, so I go off to Camp Thoreau,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.920
and I got the job because I'd been in au pair,

07:55.920 --> 07:57.160
so I knew how to deal with children,

07:57.160 --> 07:59.120
I'd been a camp counselor during the summers

07:59.120 --> 08:01.400
in New Jersey at a day camp, so I get the job,

08:01.400 --> 08:04.440
I go off to Camp Thoreau, and I'm doing pretty well,

08:04.440 --> 08:06.360
and then a friend of mine sends me Lolita,

08:06.360 --> 08:07.840
which I had never read before,

08:07.840 --> 08:09.720
which is not the best sort of reading material

08:09.720 --> 08:12.720
when there's 12 and 13 year old girls running around,

08:12.720 --> 08:15.600
it completely distracted me in the wrong way,

08:15.600 --> 08:18.600
and so one night I got very drunk as always,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.600
and ate some food, and the whole next day,

08:20.600 --> 08:21.760
I was hungover the whole day,

08:21.760 --> 08:23.520
had a terrible headache into the night,

08:23.520 --> 08:26.440
and I was sort of walking around the camp,

08:26.440 --> 08:27.880
trying to clear my head of this headache

08:27.880 --> 08:30.280
that had lasted all day, and I see a light on

08:30.280 --> 08:34.320
at the art counselor's cabin, and so I go to see her,

08:34.320 --> 08:38.480
and she was 34, and I said, do you have an aspirin,

08:38.480 --> 08:41.240
and she gets me an aspirin, and I had admired her

08:41.240 --> 08:42.840
down by the lake, because I had noticed that

08:42.840 --> 08:44.880
you could see some pubis sticking out from the sides,

08:44.880 --> 08:47.400
and I thought this was a more appropriate target

08:47.400 --> 08:49.640
for my affections than these young girls

08:49.640 --> 08:53.280
and the Nabokov influence, so she gets me an aspirin,

08:53.280 --> 08:55.880
and we're sort of chatting, and right in that moment,

08:55.880 --> 08:58.880
a bat flies right between us, and we both scream,

08:58.880 --> 09:00.800
out in the woods there in New Hampshire,

09:00.800 --> 09:02.880
and I say, well maybe if we, and it's flying around,

09:02.880 --> 09:04.360
I said, maybe if we turn the lights off,

09:04.360 --> 09:07.720
I think bats are blind, but if we turn the lights off,

09:07.760 --> 09:09.960
it'll see, I don't know what my reasoning was,

09:09.960 --> 09:13.280
so I turn the lights off, and we wait,

09:13.280 --> 09:16.040
I turn the lights back on, no bat, and I felt very much,

09:16.040 --> 09:19.880
oh, I really am a woodsman, very much a Camp Thoreau fellow,

09:19.880 --> 09:22.120
and right in that moment of hubris, as always,

09:22.120 --> 09:25.220
the bat flies right between us, like some sort of mad cupid

09:25.220 --> 09:28.600
goes right between us, and I turn the lights off again,

09:28.600 --> 09:31.600
I put my arm around her, and one touch leads to another,

09:31.600 --> 09:35.000
I think Blake has a poem about that, so anyway,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.080
we end up in bed, and I remember the rule

09:37.080 --> 09:39.760
that I had learned the year before with another older woman,

09:39.760 --> 09:41.960
do not ask if you can have an ultimate moment,

09:41.960 --> 09:43.480
just go ahead, and when you're ready,

09:43.480 --> 09:45.320
have your ultimate moment, appropriately,

09:45.320 --> 09:46.680
perhaps after she may have had one,

09:46.680 --> 09:49.400
but I don't know if I knew that at 21.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.200
So I had two ultimate moments that night,

09:52.200 --> 09:55.000
it was quite lovely, but the next day,

09:55.000 --> 09:56.760
it turned out I was terribly ill,

09:56.760 --> 09:58.600
and I ended up having salmonella poisoning,

09:58.600 --> 10:01.100
because I'd been drinking the night before in some bar

10:01.100 --> 10:02.840
and ate something off the floor, who knows what,

10:02.840 --> 10:05.240
but so I had salmonella poisoning,

10:05.280 --> 10:07.120
and I ended up in Dartmouth Hospital,

10:07.120 --> 10:09.360
and the camp year came to an end,

10:09.360 --> 10:11.240
I never made love with the art counselor again,

10:11.240 --> 10:13.820
but we parted amicably, it was very sweet,

10:13.820 --> 10:17.800
and I go back to Princeton, become a conscientious objector,

10:17.800 --> 10:20.200
I stole a novel after senior year,

10:20.200 --> 10:22.040
I moved to New York to work on this novel,

10:22.040 --> 10:25.640
and I get a letter from far away in the United States,

10:25.640 --> 10:28.080
and I open it up, and it turns out,

10:28.080 --> 10:29.840
it's a letter from the art counselor,

10:29.840 --> 10:34.240
and with the letter is a picture of a 15-month-old baby boy

10:34.240 --> 10:36.160
with red hair and blue eyes,

10:36.160 --> 10:37.640
and I'm told that it's my son,

10:37.640 --> 10:40.080
and nine months of pregnancy, 15 months of his life,

10:40.080 --> 10:41.720
it was exactly two years ago,

10:41.720 --> 10:42.800
and I was like, oh my God,

10:42.800 --> 10:45.600
and it looked exactly like I did,

10:45.600 --> 10:48.520
so sure enough, this moment that had begun

10:48.520 --> 10:51.160
on Cornelia Street, and of course you can,

10:51.160 --> 10:54.200
and then being an au pair and getting a camp job

10:54.200 --> 10:57.920
and all this drinking had led to me looking at a child,

10:57.920 --> 11:02.920
and I was 23 now, and so I went to where they lived,

11:03.080 --> 11:06.640
and I became his dad, and it turned out,

11:06.640 --> 11:08.480
all this au pair and counseling

11:08.480 --> 11:10.040
had been wonderful training,

11:10.040 --> 11:12.080
and I don't mean to be sentimental,

11:12.080 --> 11:13.160
but that's why we have the word,

11:13.160 --> 11:14.280
because sometimes it happens,

11:14.280 --> 11:19.280
so I became his dad, and I have to say,

11:19.320 --> 11:21.520
it's the best job I've ever had,

11:21.520 --> 11:24.360
and my son is now 17, and he comes up in two days

11:24.360 --> 11:25.520
to be with me for 10 days,

11:25.520 --> 11:27.000
and I see him about every eight weeks,

11:27.000 --> 11:28.240
and he's a beautiful boy,

11:28.240 --> 11:30.360
and we've had an incredible father-son thing

11:30.360 --> 11:31.880
for 15 years now,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.520
so that's my story, and it all began with these jobs,

11:35.520 --> 11:38.680
and somehow ended up there rather beautifully,

11:38.680 --> 11:40.680
so I'll do a Harry call.

11:40.680 --> 11:41.680
a Harry call.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.680
Eeee.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.320
A Harry call.

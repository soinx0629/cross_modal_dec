00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
I've always been an adrenaline junkie.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.360
I love driving fast in my car.

00:07.360 --> 00:13.880
I love zipping through the woods on my snowboard, my skis, and I really love backflipping my

00:13.880 --> 00:16.040
BMX bike.

00:16.040 --> 00:19.480
What I haven't really experienced was flight.

00:19.480 --> 00:25.240
It was something that I'd always been interested in, but hadn't had a lot of experience with,

00:25.240 --> 00:28.320
and specifically helicopter flight.

00:28.320 --> 00:34.960
I always thought that was the most awesome craft to pilot, being quick and light and

00:34.960 --> 00:41.520
nimble, and when I saw an ad in the Westward paper announcing an introductory offer for

00:41.520 --> 00:47.320
30 minutes of sightseeing and 30 minutes of instructional time, I felt like it was speaking

00:47.320 --> 00:50.280
directly to me.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.120
So I called them up immediately and set my appointment, and for the next few days I

00:55.160 --> 00:58.920
was extremely excited for that day.

00:58.920 --> 01:02.000
So when the day came, I got to the office early.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.920
I'm never early, for anything, but I was early on this day, and I'm walking into the office

01:07.920 --> 01:13.280
and I look over and I see a motorcycle in the shadows, this really cool looking motorcycle,

01:13.280 --> 01:17.480
and I remember thinking, these are my people.

01:17.480 --> 01:24.400
So I go in, I sign my name, I go out with the pilot, we look at the helicopter, we get

01:24.480 --> 01:29.960
inside, butterflies are going, I am so pumped, it's time, I'm going to fly this thing.

01:29.960 --> 01:35.160
I got my own set of controls, he has his own set of controls, we get our little lap belts

01:35.160 --> 01:42.160
on, get our headsets on, and then the pilot points over at this fire extinguisher and

01:42.160 --> 01:48.400
he says, I need you to promise me something, and I'm going to promise you something too.

01:48.400 --> 01:55.400
If you are on fire, I promise I will put you out.

01:57.400 --> 02:03.400
So I say back to him, if you are on fire, I promise I will put you out.

02:03.400 --> 02:09.880
He gives me a high five, we start it up, the main rotor blade starts spinning and we just

02:09.880 --> 02:15.220
lift off the ground, he just takes us right up and it's got a glass floor, I'm looking

02:15.220 --> 02:20.620
at it and it's like jumping my bike but never coming down, we just continue to go up and

02:20.620 --> 02:26.980
up and I am so stoked, we're flying around and you wouldn't believe, just out past the

02:26.980 --> 02:33.740
dirt roads, it is like an African savanna, a safari, you just see things that you would

02:33.740 --> 02:37.660
never see or realize are just out there past the city.

02:37.660 --> 02:43.020
We get up and I see this herd of deer and it's so beautiful, they're like running because

02:43.020 --> 02:46.900
they hear the helicopter and they're in a big pack and they're looking over their shoulders

02:46.900 --> 02:52.100
and we're flying above them and I'm just like how cool is this, nobody would ever get to

02:52.100 --> 02:58.140
see this and so then he zips into this little, this empty river bed and then just starts

02:58.140 --> 03:03.380
gunning it through this river bed like 15, 20 feet above the ground and I'm loving it,

03:03.380 --> 03:07.900
there's trees on either side of us and we're just zipping, winding through it and I'm just

03:08.380 --> 03:13.340
like this is so cool, I say to him, dude you need to get an awesome stereo system in this

03:13.340 --> 03:20.380
thing man, you can just rock out and he looks over at me like yeah, yeah, this is good right

03:20.380 --> 03:24.580
and I'm just envisioning this, I'm having this whole fantasy in my head, I'm like I'm

03:24.580 --> 03:28.460
going to get one of these someday, I'm going to have my own helicopter, I'm going to tint

03:28.460 --> 03:33.040
the windows, I'm going to paint it like a dragonfly, I'm going to put a sweet stereo

03:33.040 --> 03:36.060
system in this thing, people are going to be looking up in the air like hey there's

03:36.220 --> 03:41.820
Brian, look at him, so I'm just in this fantasy world, just so stoked, we're just hauling

03:41.820 --> 03:47.340
ass around, I love it and then he comes up out of there and he says alright, play time's

03:47.340 --> 03:51.700
over, business time, time for you to learn a little bit, anybody that's going to be a

03:51.700 --> 03:57.580
real pilot needs to know this, it's an emergency drill, it's an auto rotation, basically I'm

03:57.580 --> 04:02.940
going to cut the power, it's like putting your car into neutral going downhill, main

04:02.940 --> 04:06.500
rotor blade's going to keep spinning but there's going to be a big drop in altitude

04:06.500 --> 04:11.540
at the beginning, you like Elitch's rides and you know, roller coasters, that kind of

04:11.540 --> 04:16.460
stuff, you got a soft stomach or are you pretty tough, I'm like I'm good with that, I'm cool,

04:16.460 --> 04:21.020
he's okay, okay cool, because if you have a problem just let me know, I'll land and

04:21.020 --> 04:29.460
you can hurl, okay cool, bases are covered, let's do this, so sure enough, he kills the

04:29.460 --> 04:36.140
power, woo, we get that like 30 foot drop just instantly in altitude, I feel the upward

04:36.140 --> 04:42.140
draft of the air and we just kind of come into like this soft, slow drift and I'm getting

04:42.140 --> 04:47.860
to feel what he's saying you can do if you have an emergency landing situation and then

04:47.860 --> 04:51.340
I start looking at him, he's fidgeting with stuff, he's turning things, he's got a stressed

04:51.340 --> 04:56.620
look on his face, I'm just like, everything alright, he looks at me with wild eyes, it's

04:56.620 --> 05:05.700
like this is the real thing man, I can't believe it, I look out, I look down, it's

05:05.700 --> 05:12.340
like a model railroad set, these tiny little trees and my first thought is we're going

05:12.340 --> 05:22.820
to die, we are going to die, I signed up for this, I paid money to die, like you've got

05:23.820 --> 05:29.140
to be kidding me, and I'm just watching and we're slowly starting to fall towards the

05:29.140 --> 05:35.820
earth and I cannot believe this is happening, I'm just like this is a bad joke right, like

05:35.820 --> 05:39.940
when's the camera's going to come out and he's going to smile and say, just kidding,

05:39.940 --> 05:49.220
but he doesn't, he's just doing like S turns and figure eights and I'm just thinking, I

05:49.220 --> 05:54.420
never expected that this would be my last day and I start having these crazy thoughts

05:54.420 --> 06:01.100
like I put in some pictures to get developed, who's going to ever see those, who's going

06:01.100 --> 06:08.860
to get my car, like it's parked down there and I'm just like, I can't believe that this

06:08.860 --> 06:13.500
is the day, we're going to die, there's just no other way around it, you don't walk away

06:14.380 --> 06:20.780
crash and so he starts looking like he may be able to land this thing, we're coming down

06:20.780 --> 06:28.020
towards the ground and now my mind starts to shift from we're going to die to we're

06:28.020 --> 06:34.340
going to get really worked, we're going to hit the ground and it's going to suck, I'm

06:34.340 --> 06:40.780
going to be laying there with a broken back, it's just like I wear more pads when I'm riding

06:40.780 --> 06:45.620
my bike, I've got a helmet and knee pads and I've got a little lap belt and this little

06:45.620 --> 06:51.140
headset and we're in like a glass box, I'm just like, we're definitely going to get worked,

06:51.140 --> 06:58.100
so admit it to yourself, the next hour is going to really suck, you know, and so here

06:58.100 --> 07:02.700
we go, we're coming in for a landing, we're coming in about a 10, 12 degree angle, he's

07:02.700 --> 07:06.900
doing good, he's got us going about 50 miles an hour straight towards the ground and he

07:06.900 --> 07:11.780
just yells to me, he's like, we're going to hit and I just did the only thing I thought

07:11.780 --> 07:16.780
seemed right, I just shut my eyes, I took a deep breath, I put my arms out in front

07:16.780 --> 07:23.060
of my face and sure enough, we hit the ground and we just four by four across the prairie,

07:23.060 --> 07:30.500
just like, you know, bouncing across the gopher holes and then the left skid digs into the

07:30.500 --> 07:36.260
ground and it makes us stop instantly and we just jerk forward and then the main rotor

07:36.260 --> 07:42.420
blade is just going super fast, it hits the ground and it just cartwheels the whole helicopter

07:42.420 --> 07:48.220
and it smashes and breaks it right off behind our heads and we come to a stop looking at

07:48.220 --> 07:55.060
the sky and there's just smoke and I can smell jet fuel and the flight manuals are all scattered

07:55.060 --> 08:01.020
around inside the cockpit and I just shoulder the door and jump out and my feet touch the

08:01.020 --> 08:07.100
ground and I just can't believe it, I'm just like, yes! And I look up and I'm just like,

08:07.100 --> 08:12.660
oh my god, we were just up that high and now we're here and I have just like a tiny cut

08:12.660 --> 08:20.540
on my pinky and I'm just astounded that this has just happened and then I look at the pilot

08:20.540 --> 08:26.300
and he comes around the corner from his side and he's just like, I am so sorry, dude, I

08:26.300 --> 08:34.860
am so sorry and I'm just like, thank you, you did it, you landed it and he's like, I'm so sorry,

08:34.860 --> 08:42.780
Brian and I'm like, thank you and it goes on and on like this and I'm just, I'm beside myself,

08:42.780 --> 08:48.260
I cannot believe it, I'm like, I'm fine and then he just, he turns into a stress case,

08:48.260 --> 08:53.740
his hands are, his head's in his hands, he's just like, oh my god, I am so dead,

08:54.700 --> 09:00.900
he's gonna have to make a full investigation, there's a $9,000 deductible, we just rebuilt

09:00.900 --> 09:07.780
the thing, we gotta go find help, let's go, so off we go, we just go walking across the

09:07.780 --> 09:16.740
prairie and I'm just like, a pie in the sky, just like, oh wow, this is crazy, wait till I tell my

09:16.740 --> 09:27.300
friends about this one and he's stressed the whole walk and then we see a truck come rumbling down

09:27.300 --> 09:34.620
the dirt road, we're like, hey, we wave down this truck, we hop over the fence, we flag these guys

09:34.620 --> 09:41.140
down, they've got a CB in their truck, they call the paramedics, the cops, literally within minutes,

09:41.460 --> 09:48.220
it's like every single emergency vehicle within a tri-state region is coming over the hill,

09:48.220 --> 09:53.820
ambulances, fire trucks, cops, four-wheelers, everybody wants to see what's going on, a

09:53.820 --> 10:01.940
helicopter crash and people lived, what? So it's crazy, you know, the paramedics insist that I'm

10:01.940 --> 10:07.300
in shock and I'm injured, I had to have gotten hurt, I'm just not feeling it yet, even though

10:07.300 --> 10:12.780
I've walked miles to get here, I'm like, I'm fine, I crash on a regular basis on my bike,

10:12.780 --> 10:18.540
I'm good, I know when I'm hurt, but they insist on taking me to the hospital and checking me out

10:18.540 --> 10:24.540
and giving me an IV of saline and so I'm laying there and I get interviewed by the news and my

10:24.540 --> 10:32.260
phone is blowing up and it's just an insane day and I can't believe it, I'm like, it's a dream,

10:33.140 --> 10:40.260
I just go home and I'm just like, what? And I'm laying in bed that night and I just, I'm laying

10:40.260 --> 10:48.340
on my back, my head's on my pillow and I shut my eyes and I still feel like I'm falling, I still

10:48.340 --> 10:55.780
feel like I'm slowly drifting to the earth and I'm like, you know, I think I'm gonna still live

10:55.780 --> 11:01.660
boldly, I'm gonna still go fast in my car, I'm gonna still jump my bike and do crazy stuff,

11:01.660 --> 11:08.060
but I don't think I need to learn how to fly a helicopter. Thank you.

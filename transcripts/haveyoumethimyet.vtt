00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
In 2008, I was one of those young people who became obsessed with Barack Obama.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.760
I was a senior in college at the time, and after I graduated, I drove out to Ohio and

00:19.760 --> 00:21.600
I worked on his campaign.

00:21.600 --> 00:27.580
And after the campaign, I drove to Washington because hope and change.

00:27.580 --> 00:31.140
And two years later, the White House actually hired me.

00:31.140 --> 00:33.740
They hired me to write speeches.

00:33.740 --> 00:38.180
And people would hear about my new job and they would say, wow, you must be really good.

00:38.180 --> 00:42.500
And I'd say, I don't know, I hope so.

00:42.500 --> 00:47.500
And they thought I was pretending to be humble, but I was entirely sincere.

00:47.500 --> 00:52.700
It's not that I didn't think I had any talent whatsoever, it's just that I knew there are

00:52.860 --> 01:03.860
300 million people in America, and some of them are babies, but a lot of them are adults.

01:03.860 --> 01:12.060
And it just seemed unlikely that I was the best we the people could do.

01:12.060 --> 01:17.060
So every day, I walked through the gates of the White House absolutely sure somebody had

01:17.060 --> 01:18.900
made a mistake.

01:18.900 --> 01:22.860
And while this was going on, my friends and family were equally sure they now had direct

01:22.860 --> 01:27.580
access to the President of the United States.

01:27.580 --> 01:32.040
Like I'm sitting in my White House office and I get a text from my sister, Rebecca,

01:32.040 --> 01:38.060
and it says, how come the Department of Homeland Security doesn't have a mailing address?

01:38.060 --> 01:42.540
Now even in the best of circumstances, this is a disturbing question to get from a family

01:42.540 --> 01:45.880
member.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.920
And if you work in the White House, you want to know the answer to this kind of stuff,

01:48.920 --> 01:50.560
and I have no idea.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.240
And it's like this with everything.

01:52.240 --> 01:59.720
I mean, suddenly everyone has a law that only I can get through Congress.

01:59.720 --> 02:04.280
Everybody has something wrong with Obamacare that I need to know about.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.320
Mostly everybody has the same question.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.960
They all want to know, have you met him yet?

02:08.960 --> 02:10.880
Have you met Obama yet?

02:10.880 --> 02:14.320
And I say, no, I haven't met him yet, and I get this look.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.640
And it's a look I soon learned means you may be 24 years old and working at the White

02:17.640 --> 02:23.360
House, but you're still a disappointment to your family and friends.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.800
And I have to say, I totally get it.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.440
I mean, everybody thinks that the White House is either like the TV show The West Wing where

02:28.440 --> 02:31.800
everyone's hanging out with the President, or it's like the TV show Scandal where everyone's

02:31.800 --> 02:35.100
having sex with the President.

02:35.100 --> 02:41.560
But if you're looking for a Hollywood analogy, the White House is like the Death Star.

02:41.560 --> 02:45.840
What I mean by that is just that there's thousands of people, they run around the hallways,

02:45.840 --> 02:49.440
they're all just trying to make sure their little bit of their job works well.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.280
And just because Darth Vader is the public face of the organization, it doesn't mean

02:52.280 --> 02:56.560
that every stormtrooper gets personal one-on-one time.

02:56.560 --> 03:00.080
So I try to explain this whole Death Star thing, and it doesn't work.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.760
I still get that disappointed look.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.920
And frankly, nobody's more disappointed than I am.

03:05.920 --> 03:10.620
I mean, nobody wants me to meet the President more than me.

03:10.620 --> 03:11.860
And there's two reasons for this.

03:11.860 --> 03:14.780
The first is kind of corny, but it's true.

03:14.780 --> 03:19.460
I moved to Washington because I thought, I don't know what it is, but there must be something

03:19.460 --> 03:21.420
I can do for my country.

03:21.420 --> 03:26.000
I want to be the kind of person where the President of the United States is just a little

03:26.000 --> 03:29.860
bit better at his job because I'm in the room.

03:29.860 --> 03:34.900
And the second reason is I would really like Barack Obama and I to become best friends.

03:35.900 --> 03:40.940
Now, I'm not saying that every White House staffer imagined that they would become buddies

03:40.940 --> 03:41.940
with the President.

03:41.940 --> 03:44.980
I'm just saying that none of us ruled it out.

03:44.980 --> 03:46.600
Like you would hear these stories.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.460
Somebody got a fist bump in the hallway or someone else got invited up to play cards

03:50.460 --> 03:52.340
on Air Force One.

03:52.340 --> 03:54.120
And the moral was always the same.

03:54.120 --> 03:58.380
Any moment could be the moment that changes your life forever.

03:58.380 --> 04:03.500
Now my first chance at a life-changing moment came in November 2011 when I was asked to

04:03.500 --> 04:06.380
write the Thanksgiving video address.

04:06.380 --> 04:10.340
I will say up front, if State of the Union is all the way on one end of the presidential

04:10.340 --> 04:17.520
speechwriting spectrum, Happy Thanksgiving America is kind of on the other side.

04:17.520 --> 04:22.180
But as far as I was concerned, this was the most important set of words Barack Obama would

04:22.180 --> 04:23.860
ever say.

04:23.860 --> 04:25.540
And so I threw myself into this.

04:25.540 --> 04:29.860
I mean, I wrote and I rewrote and I made edits and then I made edits to the edits.

04:29.860 --> 04:33.540
And finally the day of the taping came and I went to the diplomatic room, which is one

04:33.540 --> 04:35.520
of the most beautiful rooms in the White House.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.740
It has this wraparound mural of 19th century American life.

04:39.740 --> 04:43.500
And the advice I always got was you have to act like you've been there before.

04:43.500 --> 04:47.300
So I'm standing there trying to act like I've been there before.

04:47.300 --> 04:50.980
And the woman behind the camera takes one look at me and goes, this is your first time

04:50.980 --> 04:52.580
here, isn't it?

04:52.580 --> 04:53.580
And I crack immediately.

04:53.580 --> 04:55.740
I'm just like, yes, I have never been here before.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.260
Please help me.

04:57.260 --> 04:58.360
And she says, don't worry.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.120
She explains her name is Hope Hall.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.080
She films the president all the time.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.400
She's going to take care of everything.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.400
All I have to do is wait.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.600
So I wait and I wait and I wait and I wait.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.660
And just when I'm wondering, is this whole thing a nightmare?

05:12.660 --> 05:14.400
Is it a practical joke?

05:14.400 --> 05:18.100
Somebody gets an email on their Blackberry and they say, okay, he's moving.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.820
And then there's kind of a crackling in the air.

05:20.820 --> 05:25.520
And a minute later, President Obama enters the room and he's standing up.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.120
So we all stand up and he sits down.

05:28.120 --> 05:33.320
So we all sit down and he looks at the camera to start taping when Hope stops him.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.940
And she says, actually, Mr. President, this is David.

05:36.940 --> 05:39.800
This is the first video he's ever written for you.

05:39.800 --> 05:52.000
And President Obama looks at me and he says, oh, how's it going, David?

05:52.040 --> 05:56.800
I had exactly one thought in that moment.

05:56.800 --> 06:04.680
I did not realize we were going to have to answer questions.

06:04.680 --> 06:08.440
And I have literally no idea what I said after that.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.400
I mean, I actually blacked out.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.360
Like I went home for Thanksgiving and my family was like, so have you met him yet?

06:14.360 --> 06:15.360
And I was like, yeah.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.360
And they were like, what did he say?

06:16.360 --> 06:17.360
And I was like, how's it going?

06:17.360 --> 06:18.360
And they were like, what did you say?

06:18.400 --> 06:22.320
I was like, I don't know, I blacked out.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.360
And I get that disappointed look.

06:26.360 --> 06:31.160
And I can't blame anybody because if I'm going to be the kind of person who makes the president

06:31.160 --> 06:34.960
a little bit better at his job when I'm in the room, I am going to have to deal with

06:34.960 --> 06:38.340
questions more complicated than how's it going.

06:38.340 --> 06:42.560
And at the moment, there's no indication that I can do it.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.320
But I make a promise to myself.

06:44.320 --> 06:51.120
I say, if I ever get another shot at a life-changing moment, I am not going to let myself down.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.000
And I didn't know if it would ever happen for me.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.440
But in fact, it happened just a couple weeks later.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.440
I was sitting in my office.

06:56.440 --> 07:00.240
I got a phone call from the chief speechwriter at the time, a guy named John Favreau.

07:00.240 --> 07:04.800
And he called me up and he said, Betty White is turning 90 years old.

07:04.800 --> 07:09.360
And NBC is doing this special where different famous people wish her a happy birthday in

07:09.360 --> 07:10.880
these 30-second skits.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.880
And you're pretty funny and no one else wants to do it.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.320
Want to give it a shot.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.440
And I said, absolutely.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.360
And again, I understand State of the Union is over here and happy birthday Betty White

07:22.360 --> 07:24.320
is over there.

07:24.320 --> 07:28.740
But this was my Gettysburg address.

07:28.740 --> 07:32.280
And so we had one week to make it perfect.

07:32.280 --> 07:35.160
We started off, John and I came up with a joke for the president.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.380
We were going to have him fill out a birthday card.

07:37.380 --> 07:42.040
And then while he was filling it out, you would hear his voice on a voiceover say, dear

07:42.040 --> 07:44.040
Betty, you're so young and full of life.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.680
I can't believe you're turning 90.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.120
In fact, I don't believe it.

07:47.120 --> 07:52.840
Please send a copy of your long form birth certificate to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington,

07:52.840 --> 07:56.240
D.C.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.340
So we feel good about the joke, but we still need a birthday card.

07:59.340 --> 08:02.360
So one day that week, I go to CVS near the White House.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.680
It's a half block away.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.960
I grab a birthday card that I think is going to be pretty good.

08:06.960 --> 08:11.080
And then right when I'm about to leave, I realize we don't actually need one birthday

08:11.280 --> 08:12.280
card.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.360
We need two identical birthday cards because we have two different camera angles.

08:15.360 --> 08:19.680
We don't want anyone to know that the president has already written his birthday greeting.

08:19.680 --> 08:23.120
And I think, yes, this is how White House staffers are supposed to feel.

08:23.120 --> 08:27.000
I mean, I've I've saved the day.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.760
And so I walk back to that to that Hallmark rack and I get an identical card and I ring

08:31.760 --> 08:35.200
it up and I go back to my office and I'm feeling really good.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.920
And then the last thing we need, we need some way to end the video.

08:37.920 --> 08:42.440
And so what I come up with is we're going to have the president put in headphones and

08:42.440 --> 08:45.960
then he'll listen to the theme song from the Golden Girls, which is Betty White's most

08:45.960 --> 08:50.040
popular show.

08:50.040 --> 08:54.360
So I find the perfect pair of headphones that go over the ear, they look great on camera.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.600
And I listen to the Golden Girls theme song on repeat just to get in the mood.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.680
And then finally, on Friday, I get the call.

09:01.680 --> 09:02.680
Come on over.

09:02.680 --> 09:08.400
Now, here's what they don't tell you about having a meeting in the Oval Office.

09:08.400 --> 09:13.280
When you have a meeting in the Oval Office, you do not just walk into the Oval Office.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.800
The first thing you do, you wait in this kind of windowless chamber.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.560
It's a little like a doctor's office, except instead of last year's Marie Claire magazine,

09:20.560 --> 09:23.680
they have priceless pieces of American art.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.000
And instead of receptionist, they have a man with a gun who in a worst case scenario is

09:27.000 --> 09:31.720
legally obligated to kill you.

09:31.760 --> 09:37.040
It turns out this little room is the perfect place to second guess every life choice you

09:37.040 --> 09:40.760
have ever made.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.320
And so I'm sitting there with Hope Hall, the videographer, and I'm just thinking, do I

09:44.320 --> 09:46.320
remember how to explain the joke?

09:46.320 --> 09:47.840
Are both of the birthday cards in there?

09:47.840 --> 09:49.200
I check my pants pocket.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.760
Are the headphones still there?

09:50.760 --> 09:51.760
Are the headphones still there?

09:51.760 --> 09:53.160
Are the headphones still there?

09:53.160 --> 09:57.200
I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown when finally one of the president's aides pokes

09:57.200 --> 09:59.960
her head out and says, OK, he's ready for you.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.960
Go on in.

10:01.960 --> 10:09.280
To my credit, the first time I entered the Oval Office, I do not black out.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.420
I can remember this very clearly.

10:11.420 --> 10:15.600
Right in front of me, I can see a painting of the Statue of Liberty that was done by

10:15.600 --> 10:21.280
Norman Rockwell that someone has told me is valued at $12 million.

10:21.280 --> 10:26.760
And behind me, out of the corner of my eye, I can see the Emancipation Proclamation.

10:26.760 --> 10:32.160
Not a photocopy of the Emancipation Proclamation, the Emancipation Proclamation.

10:32.160 --> 10:36.600
And I can feel the message that this document is sending through the room.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.400
And that message is, I'm here because I freed the slaves.

10:39.400 --> 10:49.920
What are you doing here?

10:49.920 --> 10:55.760
And I look across the desk at the president, and I realize he may also be wondering what

10:55.760 --> 10:58.320
I'm doing here.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.320
But I feel great.

10:59.320 --> 11:04.560
I mean, I've spent an entire week just practicing how to explain this one joke to the president.

11:04.560 --> 11:08.860
So I step up, I look at him, and I open my mouth.

11:08.860 --> 11:13.580
And what comes out is like I'm trying to ask for directions, but in Spanish.

11:13.580 --> 11:17.000
Like the nouns and the verbs are there, but there's nothing in between them.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.120
I just say, Betty White, video, NBC, very funny, everybody laughs, está bien?

11:23.120 --> 11:32.040
And the president gives me kind of a confused look.

11:32.040 --> 11:36.400
And I hope the videographer jumps in and explains everything and rescues me.

11:36.400 --> 11:40.520
But I'm a little concerned because I am here to show the president how professional I am.

11:40.520 --> 11:44.160
And in my professional opinion, we are not off to a great start.

11:44.160 --> 11:49.740
Still, I'm not that worried because I have that second birthday card in my pocket.

11:49.740 --> 11:55.100
And so I'm going to get a chance to show President Obama how I save the day.

11:55.100 --> 11:59.340
And as soon as hope is finished filming, even I am surprised by how confident I sound when

11:59.340 --> 12:03.640
I walk up to the desk and I put my hand down and I say, Mr. President, I'm going to need

12:03.640 --> 12:07.500
to take that birthday card and replace it with this identical birthday card because

12:07.500 --> 12:12.140
we don't want anyone to know you've already written your birthday greeting.

12:12.140 --> 12:17.140
And President Obama looks up at me and he says, we're filming this from all the way

12:17.140 --> 12:18.880
across the room?

12:18.880 --> 12:21.280
And I say, yes, that's right.

12:21.280 --> 12:29.200
And he says, so no one's going to see the inside of the card.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.320
And I say, yes, that's right.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.600
And he says, so I can just pretend to write in the card?

12:35.600 --> 12:39.360
We don't actually need another one?

12:39.360 --> 12:45.880
And I say, yes, that's right.

12:45.880 --> 12:51.960
And I put the card back in my pocket and it's strike two.

12:51.960 --> 12:55.400
But I'm not giving up yet because I made that promise to myself.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.340
And besides, I really do feel good about the ending with the headphones.

12:59.340 --> 13:04.160
And so the moment hope is done filming her second camera angle, I walk back up to the

13:04.160 --> 13:08.840
president and I reach into my pocket and I pull out what looks like a hairball made out

13:08.840 --> 13:11.040
of wires.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.520
I don't really know what happened.

13:12.560 --> 13:16.440
I guess somewhere in that waiting room, I have just worried this thing into a hopeless

13:16.440 --> 13:21.080
tangle and now I don't know what to do so I just hand the entire thing to the president

13:21.080 --> 13:27.680
of the United States.

13:27.680 --> 13:35.120
Now if you work in the White House, you will hear the phrase, there is no commodity on

13:35.120 --> 13:39.640
earth more valuable than a president's time.

13:39.680 --> 13:50.120
Which I always thought was a cliche until I watched Barack Obama untangle headphones

13:50.120 --> 14:04.200
for 30 seconds while looking directly at me.

14:04.200 --> 14:12.080
And he untangles and untangles and when he finishes, he looks at hope and just goes,

14:12.080 --> 14:14.720
shoddy advance work.

14:14.720 --> 14:19.760
And he does it in this way that lets you know that A, he's only joking and B, he is not

14:19.760 --> 14:25.020
even a tiny bit joking.

14:25.020 --> 14:27.720
And I'll tell you, my heart just sinks.

14:27.720 --> 14:33.200
I mean, this was my third chance to make a second first impression on the president.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.800
And I let myself down and all I want to do is get out of there.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.360
And President Obama says something like, well, would it be funnier if I bobbed my head in

14:40.360 --> 14:41.360
time to the music?

14:41.360 --> 14:43.480
And I say, yeah, that would be funnier.

14:43.480 --> 14:48.520
But my heart isn't in it, I mean, I know I don't belong there.

14:48.520 --> 14:53.760
And the president looks into the camera to tape this final scene and then suddenly he

14:53.760 --> 15:02.640
stops and he says, well, wait a second, if I'm going to bob my head in time to the music,

15:02.640 --> 15:06.000
I need to know how the music goes.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.200
Does anyone here know the Golden Girls theme song?

15:12.200 --> 15:16.280
And President Obama looks at hope and hope doesn't say anything.

15:16.280 --> 15:20.280
So I look at hope and hope doesn't say anything.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.280
So President Obama looks at me.

15:23.280 --> 15:33.760
And suddenly, I know exactly what I can do for my country.

15:33.760 --> 15:39.480
And so I'm standing there in the Oval Office with the Emancipation Proclamation right behind

15:39.480 --> 15:42.120
me.

15:42.120 --> 15:46.460
And I look our commander in chief in the eye.

15:46.460 --> 15:59.580
And I say, thank you for being a friend, travel down the road and back again, something, something

15:59.580 --> 16:04.540
you're a pal and a confidant.

16:04.540 --> 16:05.660
But he looks kind of amused.

16:05.660 --> 16:06.660
So I keep going.

16:06.660 --> 16:11.520
I'm like, and if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew.

16:11.520 --> 16:16.620
And that's when he gives me a look that's like, okay, President's time.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.140
But it works.

16:18.140 --> 16:22.320
President Obama bobs his head in time to the music and Betty White gets her card and NBC

16:22.320 --> 16:23.960
gets their special.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.680
And I leave the Oval Office that day with my head held high, knowing that the President

16:27.680 --> 16:33.680
of the United States was just a tiny bit better at his job because I was in the room.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.400
And people still ask me after that, they still say, have you met him yet?

16:37.400 --> 16:39.160
Have you met Obama yet?

16:39.160 --> 16:42.880
And I can finally say, yeah, actually I have.

16:42.880 --> 16:50.800
And then just to myself, I think, not to brag or anything, but technically, I'm thankful

16:50.800 --> 16:51.800
he's a friend.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.160
Thank you very much.

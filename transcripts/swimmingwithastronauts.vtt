00:00.000 --> 00:07.720
A couple of weeks after I got my phone call from NASA that I was selected to be an astronaut,

00:07.720 --> 00:11.600
my information packet came in the mail.

00:11.600 --> 00:17.620
And the cover letter had a paragraph at the beginning that said, congratulations.

00:17.620 --> 00:24.360
And then there was the second paragraph, and it said, practice your swimming.

00:24.360 --> 00:30.680
You will be required to pass a swim test in order to go to water survival training

00:30.680 --> 00:33.960
with the United States Navy in Pensacola.

00:33.960 --> 00:41.800
And I could not believe this, because after years of applications and interviews and medical

00:41.800 --> 00:49.000
examinations from head to toe and an extensive background check, never once did anyone ever

00:49.000 --> 01:03.160
think to ask, do you know how to swim?

01:03.160 --> 01:09.960
And if they did, my answer would have been, not really.

01:09.960 --> 01:15.000
Although I grew up on Long Island and was surrounded by water my entire life, I didn't

01:15.000 --> 01:19.120
like swimming, and I completely hated the water.

01:19.120 --> 01:25.000
I was a skinny little kid who was always freezing when I got wet, and I didn't like having my

01:25.000 --> 01:26.880
head under the water.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.200
I couldn't breathe.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.480
I didn't like having chlorine in my eyes.

01:31.480 --> 01:37.200
When I would go to a pool party, I would go on my tippy toes just so my head was exposed

01:37.200 --> 01:41.920
and pretend like I was having a good time.

01:41.920 --> 01:49.680
And now the one thing that I hated and avoided my entire life had now become the one thing

01:49.680 --> 01:56.560
that I had to do well, and the one thing that was going to stand between me and my dream

01:56.560 --> 01:58.880
of flying in space.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.080
I wasn't going to let that stop me.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.880
I had the summer to get ready.

02:02.880 --> 02:08.360
I took my kids to the pool every day, and I swam, and I practiced, and I practiced,

02:08.360 --> 02:09.960
and I practiced.

02:09.960 --> 02:14.240
And at the end of that summer, I reported for duty at the Johnson Space Center, a much

02:14.240 --> 02:19.480
better swimmer, but still very, very nervous about what I was going to have to do there.

02:19.480 --> 02:26.440
And I reported there with 43 other new astronauts, but we weren't really astronauts yet.

02:26.440 --> 02:35.600
We were astronaut candidates, or as our senior astronauts called us, ass cans.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.880
We were all 44 new ass cans.

02:39.880 --> 02:46.360
And in our initial briefing, they told us how we could grow up to be astronauts.

02:46.360 --> 02:50.640
And they gave us a list of things that we were going to be doing over the next two years,

02:50.640 --> 02:57.120
all the different examinations and qualifications that we would have to get in order to do that.

02:57.120 --> 03:02.280
And the very first test we were going to have was the swim test.

03:02.280 --> 03:06.000
And I was like, really?

03:06.000 --> 03:12.440
Can't we have like a math quiz or a physics test?

03:12.440 --> 03:17.960
And then the briefer went on and said, OK, all the strong swimmers in this class, raise

03:17.960 --> 03:18.960
your hand.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.920
And a couple of the military people raised their hand.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.160
We had a Navy diver raise her hand.

03:24.160 --> 03:32.040
And then he asked, OK, all the weak swimmers, raise your hands and be honest.

03:32.080 --> 03:38.680
And I sheepishly raised my hand along with a couple of other egghead PhDs.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.480
And he said, great.

03:40.480 --> 03:46.680
You strong swimmers and you weak swimmers, this weekend, you're going to work together.

03:46.680 --> 03:51.240
And you strong swimmers are going to get these weak swimmers ready to pass the test.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.720
That's exactly what we did.

03:52.720 --> 03:58.760
And we showed up that next week, all 44 of us, to take this test in full gear, flight

03:58.760 --> 04:01.640
suit, boots, and helmet.

04:01.640 --> 04:07.800
And the feeling that day was, everyone was going to pass, and we were not going to leave

04:07.800 --> 04:11.840
that pool until everyone passed.

04:11.840 --> 04:17.160
And we got in the water, and we did our long distance swim, demonstrating all the survival

04:17.160 --> 04:19.200
strokes that we needed to show.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.400
We did a lap underwater.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.560
We demonstrated that we could save each other, do a rescue swim.

04:24.560 --> 04:30.800
We drowned proof, and we got on our back with only our mouth exposed, bringing in sips of

04:30.800 --> 04:35.520
air to fill our lungs, so we get buoyancy on the water.

04:35.520 --> 04:41.520
And then after you were good and tired from all that, it was time to tread, tread water.

04:41.520 --> 04:46.040
And in the last few minutes of that tread, they blew a whistle, and you had to bring

04:46.040 --> 04:49.000
your hands out of the water.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.040
And if your hands went underneath the water, you failed, and you had to do the whole test

04:55.040 --> 04:57.800
over again.

04:57.800 --> 05:02.600
And as I'm treading for dear life with my hands out of the water those last few minutes,

05:02.600 --> 05:09.200
I'm looking around at my new classmates, I look for Mike Fink, and don't see him anymore.

05:09.200 --> 05:15.360
But I see his hands.

05:15.360 --> 05:20.880
They didn't say anything about your head being out of the water.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.200
They only said your hands had to be out of the water.

05:24.200 --> 05:30.120
And by golly, Mike was not going to let his hands go under that water.

05:30.120 --> 05:34.560
And I realized just how determined this group of people was.

05:34.560 --> 05:39.240
These people that I had now become classmates with, future astronauts with.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.240
Every one of us passed.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.240
Everyone passed that test.

05:42.240 --> 05:49.600
And a few weeks later, we flew down to Naval Air Station Pensacola, the home of naval aviation.

05:49.600 --> 05:55.200
And for a kid who dreamt about being an astronaut and watched the right stuff a thousand times

05:55.200 --> 05:59.000
and read that book about a hundred times, I was in heaven.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.240
There were F-18s with blue angels in them screaming overhead.

06:03.240 --> 06:08.480
There were young Navy and Marine recruits exercising and running all over the place.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.260
And then there was us.

06:10.260 --> 06:16.040
And we were there to be trained to eject out of a high-performance aircraft, be able to

06:16.040 --> 06:21.360
work our parachute and our survival gear and survive in the water long enough for someone

06:21.360 --> 06:23.080
to come and get us.

06:23.080 --> 06:27.500
Now this is something that I would never dream of doing in a million years.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.880
And I found out how the Navy was going to get us ready to do this.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.520
You don't jump out of the plane the first day.

06:33.520 --> 06:39.720
What you do is you take it step by step and they build you up inch by inch, baby steps,

06:39.720 --> 06:43.600
until you're ready to do the big exercise at the end of the week.

06:43.600 --> 06:48.320
So what we started to do was get by the end of the pool, just on the edge of the pool,

06:48.320 --> 06:49.760
and jump in.

06:49.760 --> 06:54.440
And then once you got that down, you went on a platform about a foot off the water and

06:54.440 --> 06:57.680
you jumped from there and you got progressively higher.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.600
And then they taught us how to go through our checklist.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.680
Once we ejected from the aircraft, make sure your canopy was good.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.520
You needed a good canopy above your head and if you didn't have one, they told you what

07:05.520 --> 07:06.520
to do to fix it.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.320
And then you went through all your other checks.

07:09.320 --> 07:13.040
Make sure your mask is off, your visor is up.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.800
All your seat kit with all your survival gear.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.640
And then make sure, most important, one of the most important things for me anyway, was

07:20.640 --> 07:25.180
that your LPU, your life preserver unit, was inflated because that's what's going to keep

07:25.180 --> 07:27.400
you floating when you hit the water.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.720
And then pull three lines, a three-line jettison which allows you to steer the parachute.

07:31.720 --> 07:35.280
And after you got into the water, they taught us how to get away from the parachute and

07:35.280 --> 07:38.680
how to release from it because that could fill with water and take you to the bottom

07:38.680 --> 07:40.120
of the ocean.

07:40.120 --> 07:44.680
We did this step-by-step and the graduation exercise came at the end of that week.

07:44.680 --> 07:50.800
And what that was, was going to be a parasail above the gulf where we were going to release

07:50.800 --> 07:57.040
from the boat, enter the water, get out, get into a raft, signal for help and they would

07:57.040 --> 07:59.080
come pick us up and we had to do that twice.

07:59.080 --> 08:05.520
And if you did that twice successfully, you passed the water survival course.

08:05.520 --> 08:11.720
That Friday came and I'm out on the Gulf of Mexico on a platform ship getting ready

08:11.720 --> 08:17.360
to be hooked up to a cable to be taking parasailing for this final exam.

08:17.360 --> 08:21.080
And my classmate right in front of me is Stephanie Wilson.

08:21.080 --> 08:25.040
Stephanie Wilson is about five foot two and weighs about a hundred pounds.

08:25.040 --> 08:30.480
Stephanie Wilson is about the size of one of my legs.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.320
Stephanie starts marching in place, she gets a little tug from the boat, takes about a

08:34.360 --> 08:40.040
step and off she goes like Peter Pan.

08:40.040 --> 08:47.360
Then he hooked me up to the boat, to the line and I'm really, really nervous because not

08:47.360 --> 08:52.360
only am I scared of the water, I am also afraid of heights.

08:52.360 --> 09:03.360
Yeah, I know, let it out, an astronaut who's afraid of heights.

09:03.400 --> 09:10.160
I start marching in place just like they told me and then I start walking and I'm getting

09:10.160 --> 09:16.280
pulled and then I start walking faster and I start running and then I start thinking

09:16.280 --> 09:19.200
this boat is not infinitely long.

09:19.200 --> 09:24.760
I get to the edge of the platform and I'm still moving my legs, I haven't gotten airborne

09:25.760 --> 09:35.000
And I start going toward the ocean and I plunge and belly flop about 20 feet and do a faceplant

09:35.000 --> 09:41.760
into the water and then the boat starts dragging me through the water.

09:41.760 --> 09:46.860
And as I'm trying to gasp for air and look, I see this chief petty officer, our instructor

09:46.860 --> 09:52.520
in the back of that boat signaling to me telling me release from your chute, release from your

09:52.520 --> 09:53.520
chute.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.440
I release from the chute just like she told me.

09:56.440 --> 10:01.940
Then they come and get me and my LPU, the thing that's supposed to save me, the life

10:01.940 --> 10:05.840
preserving unit had popped on impact.

10:05.840 --> 10:13.000
They had a Navy doctor check me out and he turns to the chief petty officer and says

10:13.000 --> 10:15.280
he'll be okay.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.480
And she looks at me and says that's good, you still got to do it twice, that didn't

10:18.480 --> 10:22.480
count.

10:22.480 --> 10:29.640
I get hooked up to the boat again, I start marching, I start running, I hit the edge

10:29.640 --> 10:35.440
of the boat again and here comes round two with the water.

10:35.440 --> 10:46.920
But this time I skim the water with my feet, my sail inflates and I rise above the water.

10:46.920 --> 10:50.520
And then I get a signal from the chief petty officer, the green flags waving at me and

10:50.560 --> 10:52.560
that means to release from the boat and I do that.

10:52.560 --> 11:01.120
And then I go through my checklist, canopy, visor, mask, seat kit, LPU, three line jettison

11:01.120 --> 11:05.440
and I steer myself down and I keep my eye on the horizon, horizon, horizon, let it

11:05.440 --> 11:10.800
come, wait for it, I see the horizon coming up, my feet get a little bit wet, I release

11:10.800 --> 11:16.540
from my chute, I do my survival exercise, they come get me and I have to do it one more

11:16.540 --> 11:18.640
time and I can pass.

11:18.640 --> 11:29.600
They hook me up again, I march, walk, run, drop, don't get wet, come up high and I pause

11:29.600 --> 11:36.720
for a moment and I looked around, it was a beautiful day above the gulf that day, I could

11:36.720 --> 11:45.440
see the coast of Florida, I could see the Atlantic Ocean and it hit me, what I was doing,

11:45.440 --> 11:51.880
what an extraordinary experience this had been, a skinny kid from Long Island was going

11:51.880 --> 11:58.040
through water survival training as an astronaut candidate, soon to be astronaut hopefully,

11:58.040 --> 12:02.320
with the United States Navy and then I look down at the boat and frantically the chief

12:02.320 --> 12:06.080
petty officer is waving a flag.

12:06.080 --> 12:12.920
I release, do the whole routine again, land in the water and they come get me and I had

12:12.920 --> 12:18.640
this great feeling of accomplishment, more than I ever had in my life, I had gone through

12:18.640 --> 12:24.000
some tough tests as an undergraduate at Columbia, it almost killed me to get through my qualifying

12:24.000 --> 12:30.920
exam for my PhD at MIT and complete my dissertation, but those things for some reason seemed doable,

12:30.920 --> 12:35.760
this was facing one of the greatest fears I had and I had to do this in order to achieve

12:35.760 --> 12:42.200
my dream of flying in space, I just felt like a superhero getting this done and then I realized

12:42.200 --> 12:46.960
I had become a good swimmer, over those months of practicing and going through the swim test

12:46.960 --> 12:53.280
and all these lessons and the Navy, I had become a really good swimmer, I had swim goggles,

12:53.280 --> 13:04.600
I had a bathing suit, I could maybe do this for exercise for the rest of my life.

13:04.600 --> 13:11.240
Since that day over the Gulf of Mexico, 20 years ago, I have never swam another lap.

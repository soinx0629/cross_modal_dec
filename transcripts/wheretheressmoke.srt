1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
I reached over and secretly undid my seatbelt.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,420
And when his foot hit the brake at the red light,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,640
I flung open the door and I ran.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,400
I had no shoes on, I was crying.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,500
I had no wallet, but I was okay because I had my cigarettes.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,680
And I didn't want any part of freedom

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,260
if I didn't have my cigarettes.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,900
When you live with someone who has a temper,

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,740
a very bad temper, a very, very bad temper,

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,500
you learn to play around that.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,380
You learn this time I'll play possum

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,140
and next time I'll just be real nice

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,620
or I'll say yes to everything

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,820
or you make yourself scarce or you run.

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,380
And this was one of the times when you just run.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,460
And as I was running, I thought

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,200
this was a great place to jump out

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,340
because they were big lawns and they were cul-de-sacs

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,820
and sometimes he would come after me

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,060
and drive and yell stuff at me to get back in, get back in.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,140
And I was like, no, I'm out of here.

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,300
This is great and I went and hid behind a cabana

23
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,460
and he left and I had my cigarettes.

24
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,320
And I started to walk in this beautiful neighborhood.

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,320
It was 10.30 at night and it was silent and lovely

26
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,600
and there was no sound except for sprinklers.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Ch, ch, ch, ch, prrrr, ch, ch, ch, ch.

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,100
Prrrr, and I was enjoying myself

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,500
and enjoying the absence of anger

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,900
and enjoying these few hours I knew I'd have of freedom.

31
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,620
And just to perfect it, I thought I'll have a smoke

32
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,780
and then it occurred to me with horrifying speed,

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,900
I don't have a light.

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,500
Just then, as if an answer, I see a figure up ahead.

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,820
Who is that?

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,180
It's not him, okay?

37
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,740
They don't have a dog, who is that?

38
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,500
What are they doing out on this suburban street?

39
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,660
And the person comes closer and I can see it's a woman.

40
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,900
And then I can see, she has her hands in her face.

41
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,020
Oh, she's crying.

42
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,620
And then she sees me and she composes herself

43
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,700
and she gets closer and I see she has no shoes on.

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,580
She has no shoes on and she's crying

45
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,240
and she's out on this strange street.

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,340
I recognize her, though I've never met her.

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,180
And just as she passes me, she says, you got a cigarette?

48
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,660
And I say, you got a light?

49
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,300
And she says, damn, I hope so.

50
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,780
And then first she digs into her cutoffs in the front,

51
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,380
nothing, and then digs in the back

52
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,820
and then she has this vest on

53
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,740
that has 50 million little pockets on it

54
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,860
and she's checking and checking and it's looking bad.

55
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,020
It's looking very bad.

56
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,360
She digs back in the front again, deep, deep,

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,620
and she pulls out a pack of matches

58
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,460
that have been laundered at least once.

59
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,300
We open it up and there is one match inside.

60
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,740
Okay, oh my God.

61
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,540
This takes on, it's like Nassau now.

62
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,380
We gotta like, how are we gonna do it?

63
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,620
Okay, and we hunker down, we crouch on the ground

64
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,260
and where's the wind coming from?

65
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,100
We're stopping.

66
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,100
I take out my cigarettes, let's get the cigarettes ready.

67
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,660
Oh, my brand, she says, not surprising.

68
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,200
And we both have our cigarettes at the ready.

69
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,980
She strikes once, nothing.

70
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,580
She strikes again, yes, fire.

71
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,500
Puff, inhale, sweet kiss of that cigarette.

72
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,820
And we sit there and we're loving the nicotine

73
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,940
and we both need this right now.

74
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,380
I can tell, the night's been tough.

75
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,900
Immediately we start to reminisce

76
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,780
about our 30 second relationship.

77
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,700
I didn't think that was gonna happen, me neither.

78
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,380
Oh, man, that was close.

79
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,300
Oh, I'm so lucky I saw you, yeah.

80
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,500
Then she surprises me by saying, what was the fight about?

81
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,700
And I say, what are they all about?

82
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,000
And she said, I know what you mean.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,580
She said, was it a bad one?

84
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,380
And I said, you know, like medium.

85
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,340
She said, oh, and we start to trade stories about our lives.

86
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,400
We're both from up north.

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,940
We're both kind of newish to the neighborhood.

88
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,340
This is in Florida.

89
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,700
We both went to college, not grade colleges,

90
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,520
but man, we graduated.

91
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,740
And I'm actually finding myself a little jealous of her

92
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,840
because she has this really cool job washing dogs.

93
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,700
She had horses back home and she really loves animals

94
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,620
and she wants to be a vet.

95
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,460
I'm like, man, you're halfway there.

96
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,540
I'm a waitress at an ice cream parlor.

97
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,340
So that's not, I don't know where I want to be,

98
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,480
but I know it's not that.

99
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,300
And then it gets a little deeper

100
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,400
and we share some other stuff about what our lives are like.

101
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,580
Things that I can't ever tell people at home.

102
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,660
This girl, I can tell her the really ugly stuff

103
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,940
and she still understands how it can still be pretty.

104
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,960
She understands like how nice he's gonna be

105
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,620
when I get home and how sweet that'll be.

106
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,320
We are chain smoking off each other.

107
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,560
Oh, that's almost out, come on.

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,760
And we go through this entire pack until it's gone.

109
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,720
And then I say, you know what, this is a little funny,

110
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,800
but you're gonna have to show me the way to get home.

111
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,160
Because although I'm 23 years old,

112
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,960
I don't have my driver's license yet.

113
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,600
And I just jumped out right when I needed to.

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,560
And she says, well, why don't you come back to my house

115
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,320
and I'll give you a ride.

116
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,840
I said, okay, great.

117
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,200
And we start walking.

118
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,720
And we get to this, lots of lights

119
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,200
and the roads are getting wider and wider

120
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,400
and there's more cars.

121
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,160
And I see lots of stores, you know, laundry mats

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,120
and dollar stores and emergency centers.

123
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
And then we cross over US-1

124
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,420
and she leads me to someplace and I think, no.

125
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,380
But yes, Carl's Efficiency Apartments.

126
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,580
This girl lives there.

127
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
And it's horrible and it's lit up so bright

128
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,800
just to illuminate the horribleness of it.

129
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,640
It's the kind of place where you drive your car right up

130
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,000
and the door's right there.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,240
And there's 50 million cigarette butts outside.

132
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,000
And there's like doors one through seven

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,400
and you know behind every single door

134
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
there's some horrible misery going on.

135
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,800
There's someone crying or drunk or lonely or cruel.

136
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,400
And I think, oh, she lives here, how awful.

137
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,160
We go to the door, door number four,

138
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,420
and she very, very quietly keys in.

139
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,540
As soon as the door opens,

140
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,260
I hear the blare of television come out

141
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,180
and on the blue light of the television,

142
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,900
the smoke of 100 cigarettes in that little crack of light.

143
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,860
And I hear the man and he says, where were you?

144
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,060
And she says, nevermind, I'm back.

145
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,020
And he says, you all right?

146
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,140
And she says, yeah, I'm all right.

147
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,060
And then she turns to me and says, you want a beer?

148
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,780
And he says, who the fuck is that?

149
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,500
And she pulls me over and he sees me and he says,

150
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,540
oh, hey, I'm not a threat.

151
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,300
Just then he takes a drag of his cigarette,

152
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,140
a very hard, hard drag, you know,

153
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,300
the kind that makes the end of it really heat up,

154
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,820
hot, hot, hot and long and it's a little scary.

155
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,580
And I follow the cigarette down

156
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,860
because I'm afraid of that head falling off.

157
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,440
And I'm surprised when I see in the crook of his arm,

158
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,100
a little boy sleeping, a toddler.

159
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,900
And I think, and just then the girl reaches

160
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,060
underneath the bed and takes out a carton

161
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,460
and she taps out the last pack of cigarettes in there.

162
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,700
And on the way up, she kisses the little boy

163
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,820
and then she kisses the man and the man says again,

164
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,300
you all right?

165
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,060
And she says, yeah, I'm just gonna go out

166
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,700
and smoke with her.

167
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,340
And so we go outside and sit amongst the cigarette butts

168
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,420
and smoke and I say, wow, that's your little boy.

169
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,900
She says, yeah, isn't he beautiful?

170
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,100
And I say, yeah, he is, he is beautiful.

171
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,460
He's my light, he keeps me going, she says.

172
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,900
We finish our cigarettes.

173
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,140
She finishes her beer, I don't have a beer

174
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,340
because I can't go home with beer on my breath.

175
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,380
And she goes inside to get the keys.

176
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,340
She takes too long in there getting the keys

177
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,300
and I think something must be wrong

178
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
and she comes out and she says, look, I'm really sorry

179
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,000
but we don't have any gas in the car,

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,640
it's already on E and he needs to get to work

181
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,700
in the morning and I'm gonna walk to work as it is.

182
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,820
So what I did was though, here look,

183
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,660
I drew out this map for you and you're really,

184
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,220
you're like a mile and a half from home

185
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,860
and if you walk three streets over,

186
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,140
you'll be back on that pretty street

187
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,780
and you just take that and you'll be fine.

188
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,160
And she also has wrapped up in toilet paper,

189
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,080
seven cigarettes for me, a third of her pack, I note,

190
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,640
and a new pack of matches.

191
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,140
And she tells me goodbye and that was great to meet you

192
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,140
and how lucky and that was fun and let's be friends.

193
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,300
And I say, yeah, okay, and I walk away

194
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,500
but I kinda know we're not gonna be friends.

195
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,740
I might not ever see her again and I kinda know,

196
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,500
I don't think she's ever gonna be a vet.

197
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,940
And I cross and I walk away and maybe this would've seemed

198
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,420
like a visit from my possible future and scary

199
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,780
but it kinda does the opposite on the walk home.

200
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,740
I'm like, man, that was really grim over there.

201
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,060
And I'm going home now to my nice boyfriend

202
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,740
and he is gonna be so extra happy to see me

203
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,500
and we have a one bedroom apartment

204
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,900
and we have two trees and there's a yard

205
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,500
and we have this jar in the kitchen

206
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,580
where there's like loose money that we can use for anything

207
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,540
like we would never ever run out of gas

208
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,760
and I don't have a baby, you know?

209
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,480
So I can leave whenever I want.

210
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,260
I smoked all seven cigarettes on the way home

211
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,180
and people who have never smoked cigarettes

212
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,000
just think, ick, disgusting and poison.

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,760
But unless you've had them and held them dear,

214
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,700
you don't know how great they can be

215
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,100
and what friends and comfort and kinship they can bring.

216
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,800
It took me a long time to quit that boyfriend

217
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,280
and then to quit smoking.

218
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,520
And sometimes I still miss the smoking.

219
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,260
Then I stay away from him because of the work and the pain.

220
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:20,840
And even the

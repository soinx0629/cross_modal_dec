1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
I grew up a huge fan of the New York Yankees, which when I was very small,

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,960
involved going to games maybe once a year with my father, my little brother,

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,280
watching Reggie Jackson, a little bit older, watching Dave Winfield.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,320
And then when I kind of came into my teens,

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,920
Don Mattingly, who was, you know, my absolute favorite player.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,680
And as I went to high school in New York and it was kind of a turning point.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,440
The first time that I went to a Yankee game by myself and I started going to

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,000
Yankees by myself and it was in one of these games in the fall of 1991 that I

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,920
went up to the stadium and bought a ticket to the bleachers and went and sat

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,880
in the bleachers and was watching the game and noticed for the first time

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,960
something that I'd been to the stadium so many times before, but I'd never seen

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,560
this kid in right field wearing a Yankee uniform who was a bad boy playing catch

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,120
with the right fielder.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,920
And I'd never noticed the bad boy before.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,640
And this kid could not play catch for his life.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,000
He was throwing the ball over Jesse Barfield's head, the right fielder.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,200
And he was one hopping him.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,360
And I was like, you know, I'm not a great athlete, but I can play catch at least

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,760
at least as well as this kid can.

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,240
And I don't understand why he has, you know, that job.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,280
And I couldn't.

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,680
So I went home that night and I tore a page out of the program that listed all

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,440
the different Yankee executives.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,080
And I wrote a handwritten letter to everyone from Steinbrenner on down to

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,240
Stunt Merrill, who was the manager at that point, and basically said, you know,

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,040
My name is Matt and I'm 16 years old and I'm a huge fan of the Yankees.

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,760
And, you know, I don't know if you can apply for this bad boy position, but if

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,440
you can, I really would like an application.

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,160
And I'm so excited to hear from you that if I don't hear from you soon, I'm

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,760
going to follow up with with a phone call.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,960
So I sent these off and about two weeks went by.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,360
And after, you know, two weeks, I hadn't heard anything.

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,360
And so I picked up the phone and this Yankee switchboard number was on the

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,880
same list of executives.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,400
And secretary asked for the phone.

36
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,280
Hello, New York Yankees.

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,920
And I said, hi, this is Matt McGoff.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,600
And I sent a letter in a couple of weeks ago about applying for a bad boy

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,760
position and nobody got back to me.

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,480
So she is like, okay, well, I'll take your name down and I'll have somebody

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,560
get back to you and took my number down.

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,640
And another week goes by and I don't hear anything.

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
So I pick up the phone again and I call on this woman answers the phone.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Hello, New York Yankees.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,440
And I say, hi, this is Matt.

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,040
You know, I sent some letters in about the bad boy position and I called last

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,880
week and somebody was supposed to call me back, but, you know, I thought it

48
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,360
was kind of rude that they hadn't.

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,280
And so she, you know, she laughed and she asked me, how old were you?

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,440
And I said, 16.

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,040
She laughed some more and I didn't really understand what she was laughing at.

52
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,640
But, you know, she took down my name again.

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,280
She said, you know, I'll, I'll make sure that somebody gets back to you.

54
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,680
So, you know, a few days later, sure enough in the mail, a letter arrived on,

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,520
on Yankee letterhead, official letterhead and invited me to come up to the

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,520
stadium for an interview with Nick Priory, who's the clubhouse manager.

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,200
So I put my jacket and tie on and I don't even think I told any of my friends

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,920
about this because it was way, way too weird to explain.

59
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,560
So I went up, took the four train up to the stadium and walked into the, you

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,400
know, walked around the stadium and this is October, so they weren't playing in

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,720
the world series in October back in 91.

62
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,360
So it was very, very quiet.

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,720
And I walked around the stadium and walked into the Yankee lobby and there's

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,320
a security guard there and I introduced myself and I say, I'm here for the

65
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,880
batboy interview and he picks up the telephone and he's like, you know, Nick,

66
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,320
some kids here to see you and, you know, okay, so he says, you know, have a seat.

67
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,560
So I sit down in the pinstripe lobby and I'm, you know, passing about 10 minutes

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,080
waiting for this guy, Nick, to come up for the first job interview of my life,

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,200
for the first job of my life.

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
And I'm, you know, trying to think of the questions that he might ask me.

71
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
And so I'm ready to tell him what my favorite subject is in school and tell

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,160
him, you know, why I think the Yankees need a big bat behind Mattingly, you

73
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,000
know, to win the pennant next year and what, you know, Mickey Mantle's batting

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,880
average was in 1956 and like all these different questions.

75
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,480
So, you know, I'm kind of passing the time and these double doors burst open and

76
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,480
this guy walks in, obviously, Nick, but he doesn't introduce himself.

77
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,240
He's, you know, could be anywhere from 40 to 80 years of age.

78
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,400
He has this greased back hair and he has a stogie between the two teeth left in

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,280
his mouth and a chaw of tobacco possibly also and this wife beater t-shirt and

80
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,600
Yankee shorts and white athletic socks pulled up to his knees and he has shoe

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,080
polish, like black sneakers that are obviously shoe polished.

82
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,640
And he just looks at me and says, are your parents going to mind you taking the

83
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,680
train home late at night?

84
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,480
So I say, you know, I take the train to school every day.

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,640
I think, I think it'll be fine.

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,480
And he just kind of looks at me and finally I say, no, I don't think my parents

87
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,080
will mind me taking the train home late at night.

88
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,840
And he says, we'll come back opening day.

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,360
So that was October.

90
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,040
You know, I go home, I think I have the job.

91
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,440
I'm not, not really sure.

92
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,440
And, you know, six months later, opening day in 1993, I show up at 9 a.m.

93
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
I put on my jacket and tie.

94
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,040
I walk back to the stadium.

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,640
I go back downstairs, you know, through these tunnels and come to this, you know,

96
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,960
big steel door that says Yankee Clubhouse on and I walk inside and it's complete

97
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,760
pandemonium.

98
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,520
And, you know, there's these ballplayers that I'd only seen before on TV or across

99
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,320
rows and rows of stadium seats.

100
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,280
And like they're there in the flesh in front of me.

101
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,480
And Don Mattingly is over, you know, on the right.

102
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,320
And I had a poster of Don Mattingly above my bed, you know, for my whole life.

103
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,760
And he's standing right over there.

104
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,680
And Jimmy Key, the ace of the pitching staff, is over there and all these guys.

105
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,600
And, you know, opening day Yankee Stadium is not just a sports event, it's a news

106
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
event. It's the beginning of spring in New York.

107
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
And Mayor Dinkins is there with his entourage.

108
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,000
And Mayor Dinkins and Don Mattingly, you know, it's so I'm walking around and just

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,840
kind of lost. And I figure, you know, I better go find Nick.

110
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,840
So I walk up to Nick and I say, Nick, what do you, you know, I'm mad.

111
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,240
We met a couple of months ago.

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,800
What do you want me to do?

113
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
It's my first day of work.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,400
So he says, stay the f out of my way.

115
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,040
So I kind of like shrink back and throw my backpack over on the side and just kind of

116
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,080
wander around in a daze.

117
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,200
And I feel a tap on my shoulder and I turn around and it's Don Mattingly.

118
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,320
And he sticks his hand out and he says, how's it going?

119
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,720
I'm Don Mattingly.

120
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
Are you going to be working with us this year?

121
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,040
Which, you know, even at that moment, I never really thought about the experience

122
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,880
in those terms. And he could have said so many other things that wouldn't have been

123
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,000
as cool as that. Like he could have said, you know, are you who are you?

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
Or are you the new bad boy?

125
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,800
Are you going to be working for us this year?

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
But he said, you know, I'm Don Mattingly.

127
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,920
Are you going to be working with us this year?

128
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,640
So I said, I know who you are, Mr. Mattingly.

129
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,960
I'm Matt. I'm the new bad boy.

130
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,600
And he's like, great to meet you, Matt.

131
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,960
I have a very big, very big job to ask of you.

132
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
I've just unpacked all my bats from spring training.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,880
And I don't know if it was the altitude of the flight from Florida or the humidity

134
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,760
down there or what. But the game starts in about two hours.

135
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,720
And I need you to find me a bat stretcher.

136
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,920
So I say, OK. So I go, I go and find Nick and I go, you know, Nick is busy.

137
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,960
Probably half a dozen ballplayers are like bothering him for double A batteries or,

138
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,720
you know, my hat size is my hat's too small or this or that.

139
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,400
And I go up and I'm like, Nick, I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly.

140
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,840
And he lets loose with a stream of expletives that fell on, I swear,

141
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,040
completely virgin ears like I'd never never heard that type of language

142
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,960
in the movies before or anywhere, let alone directed at me.

143
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,640
So I kind of like rock back on my heels and go and find somebody I can trust.

144
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,840
Like Nick's assistant Rob. And I ask him, you know, I need a bat

145
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,520
stretcher for Don Mattingly. And Nick told me to go f myself.

146
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,960
And I don't know what to do. So he was like, chill out.

147
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,560
You know, I saw Danny Tartable using one in his locker.

148
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,320
So Danny Tartable is the, you know, powerheading right fielder.

149
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,680
I go to his locker and he's getting dressed in his uniform.

150
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
And I stand off on the side and he says, you know, how's it going?

151
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,240
And I'm like, fine, I'm mad. I'm the new bat boy.

152
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,680
I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly. And I heard you were just using one.

153
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,440
So he's like, well, I was using one, but I left it in the manager's office.

154
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,720
You should probably go check in there.

155
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,760
So I say thanks.

156
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,800
And he says, see you around.

157
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,680
Then I go into the manager's office and walk in and Buck Showalter,

158
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,480
the manager, is having a press conference with probably like eight or ten reporters.

159
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,480
And I stand off on the side and I'm kind of, you know,

160
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,840
the conversation comes to a standstill basically because there's a 16 year old kid

161
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,280
there in his Easter blazer and jacket and standing in the manager's office

162
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,040
in Yankee Stadium two hours before first pitch on opening day,

163
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,600
looking very lost and very anxious.

164
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,360
And Showalter turns to me and he's like, can I help you?

165
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,280
And I say, I'm mad. I'm the new bat.

166
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm really sorry to interrupt, but I need a bat stretcher for Don Mattingly.

167
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,120
And Danny Tartable says that he left it in here.

168
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,600
So Showalter looks down, like beneath his desk.

169
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,720
And, you know, he's like, well, you know, do you need a right handed one or a left handed one?

170
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,440
So this is the first moment all day that I actually, you know,

171
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,680
this is the first question that I had that I could answer with complete confidence,

172
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,120
because you couldn't have grown up in New York at that time, you know,

173
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,000
without knowing that Mattingly was the best left handed hitter in baseball.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,600
So I say, I need a left handed bat stretcher.

175
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,360
So he's like, well, I think we maybe have a right handed one around here,

176
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,200
but probably not a left handed one.

177
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,320
I'm like, you should try down at the Red Sox Clubhouse and see if they have one.

178
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,920
So I say, OK, thanks.

179
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
I'm sorry to interrupt.

180
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,120
I go out. At this point, I'm like sprinting down the hallways,

181
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,160
the tunnels beneath the stands, the first base stands at the stadium.

182
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,280
And I run into the Red Sox Clubhouse and find their equipment manager

183
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,440
and give him like the whole story.

184
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
I'm at him. The new bat boy for the Yankees.

185
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,240
And Danny Tartable left his right handed bat stretcher in Buck Showalter's office.

186
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
I need a left handed one. And like the game's about to start.

187
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
And he's like, calm down.

188
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,600
Like, you know, we don't have one, but we need one.

189
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,280
Like, here's 20 bucks.

190
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,040
Go up to the Sporting Goods store on 161st Street and River Avenue and buy two.

191
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Like buy a left handed one for Mattingly and a right handed one for us.

192
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,960
And then bring me back to change.

193
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
So he gives me the 20. I put it in my pocket.

194
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,800
I run upstairs.

195
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,120
You know, at this point, it's like an hour before opening day.

196
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,040
The fans are coming down, like 50,000 fans are coming down from,

197
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,400
you know, the subway in the opposite direction that I'm walking.

198
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,440
I'm the only person in the world who knows that, you know,

199
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,760
if I don't come through on this mission, Mattingly is going to go up there

200
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,160
against Roger Clemens and the Red Sox on opening day Yankee Stadium

201
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,280
with a toothpick in his hand, basically.

202
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,800
So I'm like fighting against the crowd and feeling so much weight on my shoulders.

203
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,240
And I make my way, you know, and I'm about to cross the threshold

204
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,680
of Stan's Sporting Goods when it dawns on me, like I've played

205
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,240
a lot of baseball in my life and I've, you know, been a big fan for a while.

206
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,920
And like, I don't even know what a bad stretcher looks like.

207
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,400
And this moment that I'm like walking into the store,

208
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,080
it dawns on me for the first first time, like, is

209
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,480
is this a joke? Like, could this possibly

210
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,640
could this possibly be a joke?

211
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,400
And if it, you know, but I had so much fear because, like, if it is a joke

212
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,000
and I go back and I tell Don Mattingly, you know, I'm too smart to fall for your,

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,720
you know, your BS bat stretcher story and I'm wrong,

214
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,040
I'm going to be back in the bleachers, like before my first game, you know,

215
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,400
and lose my dream job.

216
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,520
So, you know, I take three laps around the stadium, kind of convincing myself,

217
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,360
like, it's got to be a joke, like, it's got to be it's got to be a joke.

218
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,880
And I, you know, I walk back back in, I go down the stairs,

219
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,080
I walk into the clubhouse.

220
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,040
Mattingly winks at me from across the clubhouse.

221
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,720
A couple of other ballplayers laugh.

222
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,480
Mattingly goes three for five that day. Yankees win.

223
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
It was my first day in pinstripes.

224
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,360
And, you know, I didn't learn until later on that I was the first kid

225
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,160
in anyone's memory to have gotten the job without having a connection,

226
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,960
without, you know, somebody knowing somebody or my dad knowing somebody

227
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,640
or or whatever, which was, you know, a lesson, a lesson in itself.

228
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,840
And, you know, as intensely naive my pursuit of that job was, you know,

229
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,560
I was probably as naively intense in chasing the bat stretcher.

230
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,600
But, you know, the lesson in the story is, you know, when there's

231
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,880
with a great deal of persistence and a little bit of common sense,

232
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,680
even if the thing you're chasing may not exist,

233
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,920
you can sometimes will it into being. Thank you.

234
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Thank you.

00:00.000 --> 00:08.420
So I get a phone call from my mom and she tells me that my father is about to

00:08.420 --> 00:15.700
get on an emergency life flight from our home in Montana to go to Denver to get

00:15.700 --> 00:24.660
an emergency liver transplant. My mom is kind of perennially optimistic and she's

00:24.660 --> 00:27.620
telling me don't worry it's gonna be okay we're gonna pull through this it's

00:27.620 --> 00:33.740
gonna be alright but I know something is really wrong so I get the next flight I

00:33.740 --> 00:40.180
can to go from where I'm leaving here in New York hoping that I get there before

00:40.180 --> 00:46.260
my father dies and I'm really glad I got that flight as fast as I did because I

00:46.260 --> 00:52.820
was able to spend a couple hours with my father before he passed away and before

00:52.820 --> 00:59.540
I know it I'm at this side of his hospital bed with my mom and we're

00:59.540 --> 01:09.440
sobbing because he's passed. My dad was a he was a strong silent type he was he

01:09.440 --> 01:15.580
was a grew up on a farm and he was the town one of one of two town eye doctors

01:15.580 --> 01:21.340
so he could fix anything you know he could fix tractors or eyes he can you

01:21.340 --> 01:25.660
know no matter what and he was always doing it like behind the scenes you know

01:25.660 --> 01:34.020
he never wanted to take credit for it. It was apparent that my mom and I and my

01:34.020 --> 01:39.220
two brothers were gonna have to be fixing things ourself this time around

01:39.220 --> 01:45.060
and the first thing my mom did was was to call my two brothers one's a year

01:45.060 --> 01:51.420
older one is a year younger and it was gonna be really comforting to see my

01:51.420 --> 01:57.060
younger brother we were really close it was gonna he was really gonna support

01:57.060 --> 02:04.340
me it was gonna be much more complicated seeing my older brother we'd always had

02:04.340 --> 02:11.300
a really complicated relationship and there was something really big about me

02:11.300 --> 02:18.300
that he did not know and that's that the last time he saw me years and years

02:18.300 --> 02:26.300
before I was male he was not aware that I had transitioned from being male to

02:26.300 --> 02:33.340
being female and you know I always wanted to tell him I was trying to find

02:33.340 --> 02:40.540
the right time the right place trying to you know get up the nerve I was worried

02:40.540 --> 02:45.700
about his reaction maybe that you know he was a bit conservative he had a

02:45.700 --> 02:49.900
temper I didn't know how it's gonna happen and I just kept putting it off

02:49.900 --> 02:56.740
and never found the right time and here we are at the time where I have to deal

02:56.740 --> 03:01.940
with all this stuff. Mark wasn't the only one who didn't know my story my whole

03:01.940 --> 03:09.460
hometown didn't know about me either and you know I was trying to find a way to

03:09.580 --> 03:13.340
tell Mark I just kind of figured with my hometown I just I just would never go

03:13.340 --> 03:20.540
back there again so my mom calls my brother and in one phone call tells him

03:20.540 --> 03:32.900
that he lost his father and then he now has a sister and I have to say I mean

03:32.900 --> 03:37.420
Mark was he was really great he he got off the plane we met him at the airport

03:37.660 --> 03:46.140
he gave me a hug but it was awkward as you can imagine and you know I think we

03:46.140 --> 03:49.460
did what a lot of families do at times like that you just kind of fall back on

03:49.460 --> 03:58.780
tradition and we wanted to do something that my mom and dad had always done

03:58.780 --> 04:06.260
every year because you see it was my father's birthday he had passed away 20

04:06.260 --> 04:17.660
minutes before before his 65th birthday so we all went to Applebee's and we got

04:17.660 --> 04:24.700
a slice of sizzling apple pie and put a candle in it and my brother Mark who

04:24.700 --> 04:31.060
really worshiped my father got the honor of blowing out the candle and when he

04:31.060 --> 04:34.980
was blowing out the can I'm still remember the expression on his face he

04:34.980 --> 04:41.540
was you know trying to process my father's passing he was figuring out

04:41.540 --> 04:46.500
why it had been so long that the two of us hadn't talked something that really

04:46.500 --> 04:56.180
frustrated him and it was just all kind of coming together I took a business

04:56.180 --> 05:02.100
card out of my purse it was for this job that Mark didn't even know I had I had

05:02.100 --> 05:07.660
my new name on it and I wrote my cell phone number on it and I gave it to

05:07.660 --> 05:12.740
Mark I said look you know we haven't talked for so long but here anytime any

05:12.740 --> 05:18.460
place no barriers call me anywhere you know we can talk anytime you want and my

05:18.460 --> 05:27.180
mom started crying because her you know her children were reuniting and also

05:27.180 --> 05:31.980
because you know for years she had been running interference between the two of

05:31.980 --> 05:36.700
us and using every excuse in the book to explain why I wasn't getting back to

05:36.700 --> 05:41.900
him or why you know packages to me were being returned because they had the

05:41.900 --> 05:48.980
wrong name on them and if you know her job running interference was over so

05:48.980 --> 05:54.020
Mark was in shock we were all in shock I was in shock because I was thinking

05:54.020 --> 06:02.700
about the fact that you know nobody in my hometown knew and I'm wondering if I

06:02.700 --> 06:10.420
can go back for the for the funeral if I if I should go back if my mom and my

06:10.420 --> 06:17.460
brothers really want me to really deep down and I'm thinking that you know I

06:17.460 --> 06:22.020
never even thought I was gonna go back to my hometown and now I'm being I'm

06:22.020 --> 06:31.820
being pulled back right into it as contradictory as it may seem as soon as

06:31.820 --> 06:37.700
there was a reason to go back I had this really deep strong yearning to go back I

06:37.700 --> 06:43.420
mean I I had gone to school in New York and San Francisco and traveled all over

06:43.420 --> 06:48.100
the world and this place that I thought of as home that I think I've really

06:48.100 --> 06:52.900
repressed knowing that I couldn't go back there right I didn't I don't need

06:52.900 --> 06:56.700
to go back there but as soon as there was a reason for me to go back there a

06:56.700 --> 07:02.100
very strong reason I really really wanted to go I wanted to see the house

07:02.100 --> 07:07.700
the only house I had ever known growing up I wanted to go back to my hometown and

07:07.700 --> 07:11.740
these people that you know comprises community that I thought of as home

07:11.740 --> 07:21.460
right and my mom reassured me that she she wanted me to be there that she in

07:21.460 --> 07:27.100
fact needed me there for support my brothers too and my mom had a plan to get

07:27.100 --> 07:32.140
us there you know our family had been separated for a long time so she had the

07:32.140 --> 07:40.080
idea for all of us to rent a car and drive the 20 hours from Denver back to

07:40.080 --> 07:45.120
Montana so before you know it there we are in the car you know my brother hasn't

07:45.120 --> 07:51.720
seen me for years especially not as female and here we are and we we had so

07:51.720 --> 07:57.000
much to do we were planning we were planning his service my father's funeral

07:57.000 --> 08:03.880
service we were writing his obituary my mom wanted to figure out and I did too

08:03.880 --> 08:08.120
want to figure out how we could introduce the information about me while

08:08.120 --> 08:14.000
still keeping the focus on my father so she had me driving out in the you know

08:14.000 --> 08:20.320
across Wyoming 70 miles an hour she had me take dictation of her friends and she

08:20.320 --> 08:26.320
wanted to invite them over for tea so she had this really strategic list it's

08:26.320 --> 08:29.680
like you invite Judy and she's going to tell all the people in the arts

08:29.680 --> 08:33.880
community that my mom was involved in and you're gonna tell June and June is

08:33.880 --> 08:37.040
gonna tell all the people at dad's office and we'll find somebody else and

08:37.040 --> 08:44.440
she's gonna tell everybody at the church and the next night there they

08:44.440 --> 08:51.040
were 18 of my mom's best friends and the minister from the church where the

08:51.040 --> 08:58.480
service was gonna be performed they're drinking tea my mom says you all know

08:58.480 --> 09:06.000
very well by now that I've lost my husband and I know a lot of you have

09:06.000 --> 09:16.920
wondered what happened to my middle son who seemed to disappear and she said I

09:16.920 --> 09:23.920
want you to know tonight that yeah I have a daughter and her name is Kim and

09:23.920 --> 09:31.440
this is my child and I love my child and I hope you do too and we can focus on

09:31.440 --> 09:38.280
this tonight we can talk about this tonight you all are my ambassadors if

09:38.280 --> 09:44.160
someone has questions at the funeral and I'm caught up in things I want I'm going

09:44.160 --> 09:48.480
to point them to you and let you tell this story because you can talk about it

09:48.480 --> 09:57.860
in a sensitive way and she you know took a couple a couple questions from the

09:57.860 --> 10:05.260
people there and the whole tea party and did slightly different than the tea

10:05.260 --> 10:13.300
party we hear about in the news the whole thing ended with everybody raising

10:13.300 --> 10:18.260
their teacups and saying hip hip hooray for Kim hip hip hooray for Kim there

10:18.260 --> 10:23.140
were a couple amens and some applause and and then everybody went home and I

10:23.140 --> 10:30.100
swear there was a brown out from all the simultaneous phone calls that were being

10:30.100 --> 10:36.980
made dispensing the information right so then the next thing there was a viewing

10:36.980 --> 10:43.820
of my father's body at the funeral home and I had elected not to go because you

10:43.820 --> 10:47.060
know I didn't want the focus to be on me I was going to keep it on everybody and

10:47.060 --> 10:52.780
keep it on my father but my best friend Tim from high school was at the viewing

10:52.780 --> 11:01.740
and he calls me up he had only known the new me for a couple days I hadn't even

11:01.740 --> 11:09.460
told him but he knew me really well and he knew I was chickening out and he

11:09.460 --> 11:14.540
called me from the funeral parlor and he said hey I got a lot of people here

11:14.540 --> 11:21.300
they really want to see you I should probably tell you that the people he's

11:21.340 --> 11:30.820
talking about are the football team because I used to be on the football team and so

11:30.820 --> 11:47.100
applause and so Tim says where are you I got a lot of people want to see you I'm

11:47.100 --> 11:50.780
like yeah I don't want to go and you know I want to keep the focus on my dad

11:50.780 --> 11:55.260
I don't want to be he's like yeah yeah whatever either you come down here or

11:55.260 --> 12:02.740
we're gonna come up there what's it gonna be I said I come up here I guess so

12:02.740 --> 12:09.660
before I know it the football team is at my front door and a couple of them have

12:09.660 --> 12:15.500
cases of beer under their arm one case gets tossed in the snowbank to keep it

12:15.500 --> 12:20.220
cold it's just like high school and all of a sudden they're in my living room

12:20.220 --> 12:27.060
and it's this wake instantly and this show of support for me and for the

12:27.060 --> 12:33.620
memory of my father right and they're in my living room this living room I never

12:33.620 --> 12:40.700
even thought I would see again and people were either laughing or crying

12:40.700 --> 12:46.340
mostly laughing and I remember looking around the room and there's there's

12:46.340 --> 12:53.820
Kevin he was one of the co-captains of the football team with me and I look

12:53.820 --> 12:58.580
over there and there's my brothers Mark and Todd and they were you know we were

12:58.580 --> 13:02.220
all very close in age so we had friends in common and they're telling stories

13:02.220 --> 13:15.460
about my dad and there's I look over on the couch and there's Frank probably

13:15.460 --> 13:20.820
should have all you also told you that not only was I on the football team but

13:20.820 --> 13:32.100
I was the quarterback and so I look over on the couch and there's Frank he's

13:32.100 --> 13:37.700
an offensive lineman it's the job of an offensive lineman to protect the

13:37.700 --> 13:45.620
quarterback and Frank is protecting me once again 20 years later under very

13:45.620 --> 13:54.220
different circumstances and he's got his arm around my girlfriend they're laughing

13:54.220 --> 13:59.900
and knocking back cans of cheap beer and that was the moment that I knew things

13:59.900 --> 14:06.020
were gonna be okay somehow and there was one more person there that night and

14:06.020 --> 14:12.260
that was my mom and she told me something that we ended up repeating

14:12.260 --> 14:19.580
quite a bit that weekend through the services she came up and she said you

14:19.580 --> 14:29.020
know dad was always fixing things and it looks like he fixed this too she said

14:29.020 --> 14:37.820
you know even though your father has died you've been reborn thank you very

14:37.820 --> 14:39.980
much

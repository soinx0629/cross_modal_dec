00:00.980 --> 00:04.800
I love numbers.

00:04.800 --> 00:08.800
I love how straightforward and direct they are.

00:08.800 --> 00:12.660
I love how one plus one is always equals to two,

00:12.660 --> 00:17.660
and how two plus two, without a doubt, equals to four.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.960
And so when it was time for us to decide

00:19.960 --> 00:23.200
what we wanted to do in university,

00:23.200 --> 00:27.360
I knew for sure that I wanted to work with numbers.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.320
So you can imagine my joy when I heard

00:30.320 --> 00:34.420
about something called actuarial science.

00:39.760 --> 00:43.140
For those of you who do not know what that is,

00:43.140 --> 00:46.080
it's this really amazing course

00:46.080 --> 00:48.640
that has you spending your days doing things

00:48.640 --> 00:52.720
like calculus and probability and statistics.

00:52.720 --> 00:57.000
It's what insurance companies use to know

00:57.040 --> 00:58.960
the mortality rates, hence tell you

00:58.960 --> 01:01.000
how much premium you need to pay.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.640
It's what governments use to know what areas to invest.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.440
I mean, who wouldn't want to spend

01:06.440 --> 01:08.440
the rest of their lives doing that?

01:13.480 --> 01:17.220
But just before I went to university,

01:17.220 --> 01:20.040
I was diagnosed with epilepsy.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.200
And the doctor told me that I had to make sure

01:23.200 --> 01:25.160
I did three things.

01:25.200 --> 01:30.000
Ate well, slept well, and never missed my medication.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.440
So under the doctor's advice,

01:32.440 --> 01:35.760
I enrolled to do actuarial science

01:35.760 --> 01:37.960
at the University of Nairobi.

01:38.900 --> 01:41.460
A few years into it, I was lucky enough

01:41.460 --> 01:45.280
to get an internship at an insurance company.

01:45.280 --> 01:47.680
I remember my first day there.

01:47.680 --> 01:52.520
I had a mismatched suit, but it was a suit nevertheless.

01:52.520 --> 01:56.480
And the director's assistant was assigned

01:56.480 --> 01:58.040
to show me around.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.360
And since we were almost the same age,

02:00.360 --> 02:03.080
we quickly clicked and made it a routine

02:03.080 --> 02:05.520
to come very early in the morning

02:05.520 --> 02:08.060
just to share our dreams and ambitions.

02:09.140 --> 02:11.200
A few weeks into the job,

02:11.200 --> 02:14.660
the company got a really big business deal,

02:14.660 --> 02:17.520
which meant all of us had to chip in.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.960
And we spent one Friday afternoon

02:20.040 --> 02:24.780
learning how to use this new fancy photocopying machine.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.560
On Saturday morning when reported for duty,

02:29.560 --> 02:32.760
I got the honorable duty of working

02:32.760 --> 02:35.060
with a new photocopying machine.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.960
I remember walking into the copier room

02:38.960 --> 02:42.040
armed with a room of papers and a stack of files

02:42.040 --> 02:44.160
that I needed to photocopy.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.160
I opened the machine just to make sure

02:47.160 --> 02:50.160
it had enough papers as we had been instructed

02:50.160 --> 02:51.180
the day before.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.360
Then I woke up in the hospital.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.960
And the doctor told me that I have something called

03:01.960 --> 03:03.900
photosensitive epilepsy.

03:05.200 --> 03:09.040
This is a type that is triggered by flashing lights

03:09.040 --> 03:13.920
and in my case, with the beam from the photocopying machine.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.760
And since I had a known history of epilepsy,

03:17.760 --> 03:21.080
the doctor said that there was no need for me to be admitted

03:21.080 --> 03:24.240
and that I should go home and get some rest.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.600
So I went home, got some rest,

03:26.600 --> 03:28.600
and was looking forward to Monday morning

03:28.600 --> 03:30.920
to redeem myself at the workplace.

03:32.260 --> 03:35.000
On Monday morning, I went back to the office

03:35.000 --> 03:37.680
and the director's assistant told me

03:37.680 --> 03:41.220
that I had been given two weeks to get more rest.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.860
I was really excited about this

03:43.860 --> 03:47.300
because here I was doing my dream job

03:47.300 --> 03:51.340
and I was working for a company that cared about my health.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.660
And so I went home and I did some research

03:53.660 --> 03:56.100
on this photosensitive epilepsy

03:56.100 --> 03:58.860
so that I could make sure it never happens

03:58.860 --> 04:00.940
in the workplace again.

04:00.940 --> 04:04.420
And after the two weeks, I went back to work

04:04.420 --> 04:07.800
and the director's assistant told me

04:07.800 --> 04:10.400
that they'd given me two more weeks.

04:11.540 --> 04:15.860
This time around, I wasn't as excited as I was before.

04:15.860 --> 04:18.220
For some reason, deep within me,

04:18.220 --> 04:20.940
this two plus two was not adding up to four.

04:23.260 --> 04:26.020
And so in the evening, after work hours,

04:26.020 --> 04:28.840
I called the director's assistant

04:28.840 --> 04:32.580
and I asked her if she had heard anything about my case.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.700
And after a few minutes of silence

04:40.660 --> 04:43.140
in what was almost like a whisper,

04:44.060 --> 04:45.360
she said to me,

04:47.540 --> 04:51.620
Sitawa, the director said that

04:51.620 --> 04:53.860
we cannot work with someone like you.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.700
This meant that they couldn't work with someone

04:57.700 --> 04:59.460
with a health condition like mine.

05:01.620 --> 05:03.860
And after a few more moments of silence,

05:03.860 --> 05:08.120
she said that he was thinking of telling the person

05:08.120 --> 05:11.200
who'd introduced me to this insurance company

05:11.200 --> 05:12.720
to break the news to me.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.900
I can't really recall how that fun conversation ended.

05:18.900 --> 05:22.120
I don't know if she hung up first or if I hung up first,

05:22.120 --> 05:25.740
but I remember bursting out into tears.

05:28.860 --> 05:33.440
And I cried because of the pain I felt

05:33.440 --> 05:35.960
that the director of this insurance company

05:35.960 --> 05:39.320
did not have the courage or the integrity to tell me

05:39.320 --> 05:43.040
to my face that I didn't have a job anymore,

05:43.040 --> 05:45.880
but he kept giving me two and two more weeks off.

05:48.360 --> 05:53.360
But most of all, I cried because I didn't ask for this.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.720
I just started falling down.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.600
And so after a few days of crying,

06:01.600 --> 06:03.960
I turned my tears into words

06:03.960 --> 06:06.080
and moved those words to a blog.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.520
And before I knew it,

06:07.520 --> 06:11.080
people living with epilepsy were coming to my blog

06:11.080 --> 06:13.760
for inspiration and information and support.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.440
And as the numbers grew,

06:15.440 --> 06:16.880
I started a hotline

06:16.880 --> 06:20.400
and they were able to get prompt support from it.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.200
And so I started writing my own blog.

06:26.200 --> 06:31.200
I still love numbers.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.200
I love the truth in them.

06:38.120 --> 06:42.880
I love the fact that numbers tell us things about people.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.920
And from the numbers I have interacted with,

06:45.920 --> 06:49.600
I see a future where people like me living with epilepsy

06:49.600 --> 06:51.760
increase in their workplace.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.880
I also see a future where people working with us

06:54.880 --> 06:56.720
know that they can work with us

06:56.720 --> 06:57.760
and they can touch us

06:57.760 --> 06:59.800
and they'll not get this thing that we have.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.240
And this thing that we have

07:01.240 --> 07:03.440
only puts us down for a little while

07:03.440 --> 07:05.360
and after that we are able to rise up

07:05.360 --> 07:07.680
to contribute to the wellbeing

07:07.680 --> 07:10.080
of this amazing world that we live in.

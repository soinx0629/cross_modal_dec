00:00.000 --> 00:11.160
So, as I sit down to eat from this spread that has been given in my honor, I can't help

00:11.160 --> 00:14.560
but notice the two feelings that I'm having.

00:14.560 --> 00:17.400
One, I'm a little nervous.

00:17.400 --> 00:26.160
Two, I'm very excited because you see, in the morning, I'll be paroling from state prison

00:26.160 --> 00:31.120
after 26 years.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.400
The spread is given to me, not as like to say, hey, homie, we appreciate you.

00:35.400 --> 00:41.640
No, it was a spread to say, we don't never want to see your ass in here again.

00:41.640 --> 00:48.000
And they broke out the finest of the finest, top ramen, chili in a can, roast beef in

00:48.000 --> 00:53.480
a can, you know, this top line of stuff, right?

00:53.520 --> 01:00.520
So, after the spread has been had, it's time for me to give away some property, such as

01:00.520 --> 01:06.520
my TV, my radio, and some self-help books that help me a lot, so they'll be better utilized

01:06.520 --> 01:08.800
left behind.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.080
Nine o'clock rolls around, it's lights out.

01:12.080 --> 01:17.800
You don't have to go to sleep, but you do got to get off the day room floor.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.400
It's cool about me, I'm leaving in the morning.

01:21.400 --> 01:26.120
So, I may have gotten like three hours worth of sleep that night.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.840
I slept ready roll, and that means I slept with my clothes on.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.920
Soon as they call my name, I'm out of there.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.320
Bye, see you later.

01:34.320 --> 01:43.280
So 545 rolls around, the night man says, Cyprian D37-875, report to R&R.

01:43.280 --> 01:49.640
I walked down that corridor for the last time, walked through one gate after another till

01:49.640 --> 01:56.320
I get to R&R, and that's receiving and release, and I'm on the release end at this point.

01:56.320 --> 02:02.960
I get to R&R, and there's about seven to six other guys waiting for the same thing.

02:02.960 --> 02:09.920
They start fingerprinting me, mug shots, and everything, I'm cool, like, time to go.

02:09.920 --> 02:15.760
So they load us onto a van, and we drive through one gate after another gate, till we get to

02:15.760 --> 02:17.440
the final gate.

02:17.480 --> 02:22.920
The cop says, all right, everybody off the van, you'll step to the man at the base of

02:22.920 --> 02:27.120
the tower there, and you'll give him some personal information.

02:27.120 --> 02:37.640
So we did, and he gave each man an envelope with $200 in it, better known as gate money.

02:37.640 --> 02:42.140
We all got back onto the van and drove through that last gate.

02:42.140 --> 02:48.180
We made it around to the visitor's parking lot, and he asks, is there anyone with a ride?

02:48.180 --> 02:49.780
I do.

02:49.780 --> 02:52.140
I was the only one to get off the van.

02:52.140 --> 02:57.060
These other guys, that $200 gate money, they had to spend it on buying their bus tickets,

02:57.060 --> 03:03.140
maybe back to Southern California or even further up north, but I was the lucky one.

03:03.140 --> 03:05.700
My wife was waiting there.

03:05.700 --> 03:10.060
With her camera, I could see her, she was snapping pictures of me like a paparazzi.

03:10.100 --> 03:15.220
I walked briskly towards her, gave her a quick kiss, whispered it in her ear, let's get out

03:15.220 --> 03:20.740
of here before they say we made a mistake.

03:20.740 --> 03:26.380
We got in the car, drove away, I saw a 7-Eleven, I was like, hey babe, pull over, I want to

03:26.380 --> 03:29.020
go in and get something.

03:29.020 --> 03:33.220
So I went in and grabbed a pack of Big Red gum.

03:33.220 --> 03:36.900
I hadn't had chewing gum in 26 years.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.640
Big Red was my favorite.

03:39.640 --> 03:48.640
We got back in the car, drove away, we were on the road for about 30 to 45 minutes.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.680
I spotted a Target.

03:50.680 --> 03:57.120
I said, hey babe, that's Target, I saw that on the TV, pull over, I want to go in there.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.000
So we did.

03:59.000 --> 04:08.480
The first thing that caught my eye was how big the shopping basket was.

04:08.480 --> 04:14.640
It was bigger than the space that I had to store my personal property while in prison.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.920
I grabbed the basket and went down the aisle grabbing various things such as underwear,

04:18.920 --> 04:23.440
socks, t-shirt, toothbrush, toothpaste, you name it, I grabbed it.

04:23.440 --> 04:28.280
Well, that goes at $200 gate money.

04:28.280 --> 04:36.040
So back in the car, and my wife says, so what do you want for dinner?

04:36.040 --> 04:39.120
She stumped me with that one.

04:39.120 --> 04:43.040
Because for 26 years, no one had ever asked me, what do I want for dinner?

04:43.040 --> 04:46.760
My dinner came through a 13 by 13 hole in the wall.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.800
You stick your hand in there and pull out a tray and what's ever on there, that's what

04:49.800 --> 04:53.860
you eat.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.640
So she says, I know what to fix.

04:55.640 --> 05:01.560
So she drove, we made it to the grocery store, went into the grocery store.

05:01.560 --> 05:11.400
This gigantic store, Berkeley Bowl.

05:11.400 --> 05:16.340
So I made it to the produce section.

05:16.340 --> 05:18.640
I'm stuck.

05:18.640 --> 05:22.900
There are so many oranges to choose from.

05:22.900 --> 05:27.600
And the reason I'm stuck just looking at the oranges is because for the past 10 years in

05:28.240 --> 05:34.980
prison, they had taken oranges away from us because they were used to make wine.

05:34.980 --> 05:40.960
So there's like a bumpy orange, a smooth orange, a naval orange.

05:40.960 --> 05:47.040
I even met my first blood orange.

05:47.040 --> 05:55.080
And at the same time, this wave hit me of alone and feeling like, I don't know, a nervous

05:55.080 --> 06:00.680
feeling hit me like I'm the only person in this store who's paroled from a prison today

06:00.680 --> 06:03.000
after 26 years.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.280
I'm a little stuck and a little, ooh.

06:07.280 --> 06:11.960
So I'm looking around and I spot this ink work.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.760
It's not the typical ink work that I see out here now.

06:14.760 --> 06:15.760
Like what color?

06:15.760 --> 06:17.080
No, I know this ink work.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.280
This is prison ink.

06:18.280 --> 06:23.680
He has a prison guard tower on him, a melted clock with time.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.680
I know that work.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.400
I've seen that many times.

06:26.400 --> 06:31.800
So I walk over to him and I whisper, so what yard did you parole from?

06:31.800 --> 06:32.800
He said, oh me?

06:32.800 --> 06:35.440
I got, I paroled from Pelican Bay like four months ago.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.600
I'm like, and they know you got out of prison?

06:38.600 --> 06:39.600
They know you're on parole?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.000
Oh yeah, they're not tripping here.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
This is Berkeley, man.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.120
Nobody's tripping.

06:46.120 --> 06:53.920
Well I walked away from him with the understanding that if he can get a job, so can I.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.200
So I met my wife at the checkout.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.360
Once again, there's another stunned moment for me.

07:00.360 --> 07:07.120
There are 12 checkout lines and there's somebody on the other end bagging the groceries.

07:07.120 --> 07:15.040
In prison, there was one window, maybe 13 by 13 again, and there was like 300 guys waiting

07:15.040 --> 07:21.680
to get into this one window with their lists.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.480
I didn't have to worry about an alarm going off or anything, no getting down.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.640
We're going to get our groceries and leave out of here.

07:27.640 --> 07:28.960
That was my thought.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.720
Cool.

07:30.720 --> 07:35.320
So we made it through the checkout, went back to the car, got in the car and we're on the

07:35.320 --> 07:40.080
road and we come to a stoplight.

07:40.080 --> 07:45.780
And this homeless guy had a sign that says, anything will help.

07:45.780 --> 07:51.160
So my wife reaches into the cup holder and gets ready to hand him some change.

07:51.160 --> 07:54.640
And all of a sudden he gets a phone call.

07:54.640 --> 08:01.600
And he tells my wife, wait, I got to get this.

08:01.600 --> 08:09.000
And my thoughts were like, if he got a cell phone, I got to get one.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.560
So we drive away and my wife, she just drives real fast, right?

08:15.560 --> 08:20.320
And we make it to the neighborhood just as fast as we got to the store and she pulls

08:20.400 --> 08:23.760
into the neighborhood and she points out the various neighbors house.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.240
This is where Fred and Mike live.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.360
The brewers live here.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.440
And I'm like, OK, and we get to our house.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.880
And she said, and this is us.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.800
We live at the edge of the forest.

08:33.800 --> 08:36.880
Like, cool, cool.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.440
And so we went inside and she gives me the grand tour.

08:40.440 --> 08:44.600
And so she says, well, I'm going to prepare this dinner.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.160
I said, cool.

08:46.200 --> 08:50.360
So she made steak and lobster with small potatoes.

08:50.360 --> 08:53.440
Nothing out of a can, folks.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.720
Nothing out of a packet either.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.040
She made this meal.

08:57.040 --> 08:57.840
We sat down.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.760
We ate.

08:59.760 --> 09:05.360
And I had my first glass of wine with my meal.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.400
I'm not saying I've never had wine before.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.880
I've never had wine with a meal.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.840
This is some grown folks shit, I thought.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.240
Right?

09:19.240 --> 09:25.360
So after the meal was finished, we're cleaning up, washing dishes.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.760
My wife says, you want to get further acclimated?

09:28.760 --> 09:31.000
I'm like, yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.520
She said, take out the garbage.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.040
No problem.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.720
I reach down, tie that garbage bag up, throw it over my shoulder,

09:41.720 --> 09:44.280
and out to the front door I go.

09:44.280 --> 09:48.920
When I open up the door, no more than eight feet away from me

09:48.920 --> 09:53.720
was a 10-point buck just standing there, looking at me,

09:53.720 --> 09:56.960
looking at it, staring at me.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.640
Now, had we been on a prison yard,

09:58.640 --> 10:02.320
me and his buck would have had issues.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.560
Now, I speak a lot of different gangster languages.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.920
I'm fluent in Crip.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.120
I understand blood.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.280
I even speak a little ese cholo vato loco.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.520
But I don't speak deer.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.080
So I shut the door.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.200
I called out to my wife.

10:18.200 --> 10:23.360
I said, hey, babe, there's somebody here to see you.

10:23.360 --> 10:27.360
She came to the door, opened it, and saw there was the buck.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.360
She grabbed the trash bag and walked right past it.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.160
I said, damn, she speaks deer.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.960
I said, damn, she speaks deer.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.520
She came back, and we both look out the door

10:41.520 --> 10:44.520
together at this buck who's still standing there,

10:44.520 --> 10:47.240
just looking just majestic as could be.

10:50.240 --> 10:54.000
And my wife says, you don't need to trip him.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.240
He's just one neighbor coming to welcome you to the neighborhood.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.160
Cool.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.800
I thought, well, the fellas aren't

11:01.800 --> 11:05.000
going to believe this shit when I tell them this.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.440
I met my first deer.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.720
I met my first blood orange.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.400
I had my first glass of wine with my meal.

11:17.280 --> 11:21.400
This is my first day of my new life.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.320
What's tomorrow going to bring me?

11:24.320 --> 11:25.880
Thank you.

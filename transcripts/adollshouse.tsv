0	2540	All right, thank you very much.
2540	4540	All right, this is my story.
5680	8560	I was dating this girl like two years ago.
8560	9600	Been dating her for like eight months
9600	11600	since she wanted to meet my parents.
11600	12440	She was really giving me shit,
12440	14240	like, how come I haven't met your parents?
16240	20760	And, you know, I always just, I never liked,
20760	21880	you know, I never brought anybody home
21880	23720	to meet my parents, I was like 30 years old.
23720	26160	Never met, brought anybody home.
26160	29020	Never, I didn't ever like meeting people in general.
30320	32600	God, I didn't want to meet her parents.
32600	33440	I always hated when you had to meet,
33440	34520	like, you know, go out with somebody,
34520	37280	you gotta like meet their friends and shit.
37280	40760	You know, sitting at the table trying to be interesting.
40760	42280	I usually end up just sitting there staring at
42280	44620	like mashed potatoes or some shit.
44620	46680	So she's like, you know, how come, what's wrong with you?
46680	48560	You know, how come you don't want to meet me, you know,
48560	50560	bring you home to meet your parents?
50560	52040	I started thinking about it, like, you know,
52040	54600	not only had I never brought anybody home,
54600	56580	you know, a girl home, and I was 30 years old,
56580	58680	I'd never brought anybody home.
58680	61200	Even like back in like first grade,
61200	62760	like second grade, I may have friends and shit,
62760	64920	I just never brought them home.
64920	67160	So I started thinking like, you know,
67160	69280	how the hell did that start?
69280	71360	You know, as you know, so we're basically driving up
71360	74440	from New York to go to my house to finally meet my parents.
74440	77760	And I remember like, I think it was like
77760	80000	when I was first grade, we used to have a bus stop,
80000	81360	and it was like right out in front of my house,
81360	83720	so my parents used to always be arguing.
83720	85080	My dad was like a maniac, you know,
85480	89920	God damn fucking bitch, you know, just total psycho.
89920	92440	My dad was like a complete psychopath, you know,
92440	95000	like his nickname in my house was called The Thing.
95920	97040	Because that's what he was, he was like,
97040	100360	he was this fucking thing that like, if he wasn't around,
100360	101920	we'd say, dude, is The Thing home?
101920	104320	You know, if he wasn't home, he could chill.
104320	105800	He was just like never in a good mood.
105800	107120	So one day I'm down at the bus stop,
107120	109240	there's like, you know, 10 other kids down there and shit,
109240	111380	we're all like in first grade, second grade,
111380	113000	third grade waiting for the bus.
113000	114200	And it's like towards the summertime,
114200	116760	my parents got like the windows open and shit.
116760	119120	So I can start to hear like an argument start,
119120	120280	and I'm like, well, what the fuck do you mean,
120280	121640	you didn't know?
121640	123000	And I'm sitting there like, please,
123000	125520	please let the bus come, please, for Christ's sake.
125520	127080	And all of a sudden, you're a goddamn fucking bitch,
127080	128480	yeah, screaming and shit.
129480	131400	And I remember just looking at all the other kids' looks
131400	133160	on their faces, like, I guess, you know,
133160	134440	this is like way before cable,
134440	137960	so most kids never even heard curses.
139160	140080	They couldn't believe it.
140080	141520	And I was just, that's when it really hit me,
141520	145000	that man, my family's really screwed up.
145000	147720	And I started going over other kids' houses
147720	150540	and their parents seemed to get along, they were like, cool.
150540	153960	And so the whole time I'm driving back,
153960	156600	my girlfriend coming up, all this stuff is like coming back
156600	158760	and I'm thinking, and I'm like really getting like,
158760	161000	oh, like I'm a six-year-old kid again,
161000	164280	like getting all nervous, like how my dad is gonna like act,
164280	168400	because it's like embarrassing, you know?
168440	172320	I mean, I remember like he was one of these dudes
172320	174320	where like, I don't know, he's just always in a bad mood,
174320	176480	like if he tried to like teach you something,
176480	179640	he'd say it once, and then when you didn't get it,
179640	183240	he'd just say it louder and louder.
183240	186720	And I remember six, he's going, this guy, he's retarded.
186720	188200	Like I remember we got a dog
188200	191920	and he's trying to teach his dog how to sit, all right?
191920	193520	It's a dog, it doesn't speak English,
193520	194360	and he's sitting there going,
194360	197980	and he's like, all right, sit, this little puppy, sit.
198020	201340	Sit down, you're gonna get over there
201340	203540	and you're gonna sit down.
203540	205300	Dog's sitting there like walking around like peeing,
205300	207500	like what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
208900	209900	And that was like his thing, man,
209900	210900	everything like in my house,
210900	213660	my parents, they were like ridiculously strict.
213660	214960	They had all these stupid rules,
214960	216340	like I remember they had like this one rule,
216340	218020	whatever you didn't eat for dinner,
218020	219860	they would just like wrap it in cellophane
219860	222580	and you had to like eat it the next morning for breakfast.
222580	224340	And there's like, everybody's sitting there
224340	226680	eating their like pancakes and waffles.
226680	228880	You're like eating like cube steaks and shit.
230880	232320	Dad be going, come on, eat it.
232320	233160	I don't want to eat it.
233160	234000	Eat it!
236600	238520	So I'm like driving back and that's all I'm thinking,
238520	239480	it's like, God, this guy's just gonna
239480	240800	completely embarrass me.
241560	245600	And I don't know, like it's just,
245600	247480	I just felt weird, like my family was like,
247480	250080	like the, you know, most famous like loving,
250080	252200	like build somebody up, like our family was just,
252200	254240	all of us just like ripping somebody down.
254240	258840	Like, I think the worst thing he ever did to me,
258840	260680	this is the one that really kind of made me like
260680	263920	the anxious, like worrisome person that I am.
263920	267240	I remember, it was right around Christmas.
267240	268080	I was really thinking this,
268080	270480	because I was driving this girl up for Christmas.
270480	274040	He, he was giving me shit one day.
274040	275760	He always hated when I was joking around.
275760	277520	I think making my mother laugh somehow was,
277520	279520	I don't know, bug him or whatever.
279520	280480	So he kept giving me shit.
280480	283920	Come on, man, you know, keep joking around, you know,
283960	286360	giggling all the time, you're acting like a little girl.
287480	289120	And I'm thinking like, cause he's always fucking with me,
289120	290800	I'm going, God, here's a new angle.
291720	293280	You know, you're asking for a football for Christmas,
293280	294160	you're acting like a little girl,
294160	295000	what the fuck's wrong with you?
295000	296840	And I'm just sitting there going, geez.
296840	298440	So like two weeks later, it's Christmas time,
298440	300320	I got like four brothers, right?
300320	301920	We always sneak down to go look at the presents.
301920	303320	So we go downstairs, right?
304360	306240	There's all these gifts down there all wrapped,
306240	308440	we're all looking to see who got what, you know?
308440	310800	There's all these little tags, to Ed from Santa.
311600	316960	You know, be like, you know, to Bob from Mama Dad or whatever.
321960	322960	And I'm sitting there.
334400	335400	Just wait a second.
341800	345320	So I look, in like the middle of the tree,
345320	346600	I see there's a doll.
348880	350000	And I'm thinking, I got four brothers,
350000	352000	what the fuck is there, a doll sitting here?
353400	354520	And I remember just looking at this thing,
354520	356000	you ever see like those Spike Lee movies
356000	359240	where like the background moves and the character doesn't?
359240	362440	You just, it's like one of those deals.
364080	366000	And I look up at this doll, right?
366000	368240	And it says, to Bill from Santa.
369240	370800	And I'm like, what the fuck?
371920	374240	Guy got me a goddamn doll.
374240	376200	He came downstairs and he's laughing and shit,
376200	377240	and he's making me take a picture.
377240	379440	I'm like six years old and crying and stuff.
381200	383000	And I'm thinking of this shit,
383000	384280	as I'm pulling into the driveway,
384280	385120	I'm like freaking out,
385120	388040	because I'm finally gonna bring somebody home
388040	389760	to meet this fucking maniac.
390800	393720	And I'm telling her, you know,
393720	395440	I don't know how this guy's gonna be or whatever.
395440	398000	So we're walking to the house, you know,
398720	402360	it's like candles and shit, you know, Christmas tree,
402360	405320	it's all real nice, dim lights and stuff.
405320	407840	She comes in, she meets my dad,
407840	410040	and the dude is like totally normal.
412080	414600	After me building this guy up the whole ride back,
414600	416720	he's like fucking like, you know,
416720	418120	that dude from Leave It to Beaver.
418120	420560	He's like the nicest guy ever.
420560	421880	He's all cordial.
423000	425840	And I remember I'm just getting like pissed at the guy.
425840	427440	Go, why isn't he being a dick?
428360	429960	And she's sitting there and taking me aside,
429960	431440	going, he's the greatest guy.
431440	432640	I can't believe you're saying all that stuff.
432640	435400	He's such, you know, he's smart, he's intelligent,
435400	438360	he's so interested in what I have to say.
439800	442920	I remember I was like, I was so pissed at the guy.
442920	444920	I mean, I really hated him when I was growing up.
444920	447200	To the point, I remember one time he went out on the driveway
447200	448880	and he's running out to his car,
448880	451920	and he slipped and fell and broke his shoulder.
451920	452840	And at that point, me and my brother
452840	454080	so fucking hated this guy.
454080	454920	When he came to the house,
454920	456400	my mother's like taking care of him.
456480	457800	We snuck out the back door
457800	460120	to look at his footprints in the snow
460120	461480	to see where he slipped and fell.
461480	463800	And I'm telling you, we were laughing our asses off
463800	464640	at this guy.
464640	467800	You're right there, right there, that's my brother.
467800	469600	Fuck, why couldn't I have seen that?
472000	472840	So,
475320	477040	so he ended up being like the sweetest guy ever
477040	478560	and there was nothing anxious about it.
478560	480600	I like worried about it for like,
480600	481560	I don't know, from the beginning of the time,
481560	482760	dating girls was like 15
482760	485360	and I just ended up feeling really stupid.
485360	488320	And I was kind of pissed.
488320	489160	I was just looking at the guy going,
489160	492280	oh, why the fuck couldn't you have been like this
492280	494520	20 years ago when I needed him to be like that
495760	500400	rather than being the way he was?
501760	503520	And that's my story, thanks.

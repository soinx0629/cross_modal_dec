0	7720	A couple of weeks after I got my phone call from NASA that I was selected to be an astronaut,
7720	11600	my information packet came in the mail.
11600	17620	And the cover letter had a paragraph at the beginning that said, congratulations.
17620	24360	And then there was the second paragraph, and it said, practice your swimming.
24360	30680	You will be required to pass a swim test in order to go to water survival training
30680	33960	with the United States Navy in Pensacola.
33960	41800	And I could not believe this, because after years of applications and interviews and medical
41800	49000	examinations from head to toe and an extensive background check, never once did anyone ever
49000	63160	think to ask, do you know how to swim?
63160	69960	And if they did, my answer would have been, not really.
69960	75000	Although I grew up on Long Island and was surrounded by water my entire life, I didn't
75000	79120	like swimming, and I completely hated the water.
79120	85000	I was a skinny little kid who was always freezing when I got wet, and I didn't like having my
85000	86880	head under the water.
86880	88200	I couldn't breathe.
88200	91480	I didn't like having chlorine in my eyes.
91480	97200	When I would go to a pool party, I would go on my tippy toes just so my head was exposed
97200	101920	and pretend like I was having a good time.
101920	109680	And now the one thing that I hated and avoided my entire life had now become the one thing
109680	116560	that I had to do well, and the one thing that was going to stand between me and my dream
116560	118880	of flying in space.
118880	121080	I wasn't going to let that stop me.
121080	122880	I had the summer to get ready.
122880	128360	I took my kids to the pool every day, and I swam, and I practiced, and I practiced,
128360	129960	and I practiced.
129960	134240	And at the end of that summer, I reported for duty at the Johnson Space Center, a much
134240	139480	better swimmer, but still very, very nervous about what I was going to have to do there.
139480	146440	And I reported there with 43 other new astronauts, but we weren't really astronauts yet.
146440	155600	We were astronaut candidates, or as our senior astronauts called us, ass cans.
155600	159880	We were all 44 new ass cans.
159880	166360	And in our initial briefing, they told us how we could grow up to be astronauts.
166360	170640	And they gave us a list of things that we were going to be doing over the next two years,
170640	177120	all the different examinations and qualifications that we would have to get in order to do that.
177120	182280	And the very first test we were going to have was the swim test.
182280	186000	And I was like, really?
186000	192440	Can't we have like a math quiz or a physics test?
192440	197960	And then the briefer went on and said, OK, all the strong swimmers in this class, raise
197960	198960	your hand.
198960	201920	And a couple of the military people raised their hand.
201920	204160	We had a Navy diver raise her hand.
204160	212040	And then he asked, OK, all the weak swimmers, raise your hands and be honest.
212080	218680	And I sheepishly raised my hand along with a couple of other egghead PhDs.
218680	220480	And he said, great.
220480	226680	You strong swimmers and you weak swimmers, this weekend, you're going to work together.
226680	231240	And you strong swimmers are going to get these weak swimmers ready to pass the test.
231240	232720	That's exactly what we did.
232720	238760	And we showed up that next week, all 44 of us, to take this test in full gear, flight
238760	241640	suit, boots, and helmet.
241640	247800	And the feeling that day was, everyone was going to pass, and we were not going to leave
247800	251840	that pool until everyone passed.
251840	257160	And we got in the water, and we did our long distance swim, demonstrating all the survival
257160	259200	strokes that we needed to show.
259200	261400	We did a lap underwater.
261400	264560	We demonstrated that we could save each other, do a rescue swim.
264560	270800	We drowned proof, and we got on our back with only our mouth exposed, bringing in sips of
270800	275520	air to fill our lungs, so we get buoyancy on the water.
275520	281520	And then after you were good and tired from all that, it was time to tread, tread water.
281520	286040	And in the last few minutes of that tread, they blew a whistle, and you had to bring
286040	289000	your hands out of the water.
289000	295040	And if your hands went underneath the water, you failed, and you had to do the whole test
295040	297800	over again.
297800	302600	And as I'm treading for dear life with my hands out of the water those last few minutes,
302600	309200	I'm looking around at my new classmates, I look for Mike Fink, and don't see him anymore.
309200	315360	But I see his hands.
315360	320880	They didn't say anything about your head being out of the water.
320880	324200	They only said your hands had to be out of the water.
324200	330120	And by golly, Mike was not going to let his hands go under that water.
330120	334560	And I realized just how determined this group of people was.
334560	339240	These people that I had now become classmates with, future astronauts with.
339240	341240	Every one of us passed.
341240	342240	Everyone passed that test.
342240	349600	And a few weeks later, we flew down to Naval Air Station Pensacola, the home of naval aviation.
349600	355200	And for a kid who dreamt about being an astronaut and watched the right stuff a thousand times
355200	359000	and read that book about a hundred times, I was in heaven.
359000	363240	There were F-18s with blue angels in them screaming overhead.
363240	368480	There were young Navy and Marine recruits exercising and running all over the place.
368480	370260	And then there was us.
370260	376040	And we were there to be trained to eject out of a high-performance aircraft, be able to
376040	381360	work our parachute and our survival gear and survive in the water long enough for someone
381360	383080	to come and get us.
383080	387500	Now this is something that I would never dream of doing in a million years.
387500	390880	And I found out how the Navy was going to get us ready to do this.
390880	393520	You don't jump out of the plane the first day.
393520	399720	What you do is you take it step by step and they build you up inch by inch, baby steps,
399720	403600	until you're ready to do the big exercise at the end of the week.
403600	408320	So what we started to do was get by the end of the pool, just on the edge of the pool,
408320	409760	and jump in.
409760	414440	And then once you got that down, you went on a platform about a foot off the water and
414440	417680	you jumped from there and you got progressively higher.
417680	419600	And then they taught us how to go through our checklist.
419600	422680	Once we ejected from the aircraft, make sure your canopy was good.
422680	425520	You needed a good canopy above your head and if you didn't have one, they told you what
425520	426520	to do to fix it.
426520	429320	And then you went through all your other checks.
429320	433040	Make sure your mask is off, your visor is up.
433040	436800	All your seat kit with all your survival gear.
436800	440640	And then make sure, most important, one of the most important things for me anyway, was
440640	445180	that your LPU, your life preserver unit, was inflated because that's what's going to keep
445180	447400	you floating when you hit the water.
447400	451720	And then pull three lines, a three-line jettison which allows you to steer the parachute.
451720	455280	And after you got into the water, they taught us how to get away from the parachute and
455280	458680	how to release from it because that could fill with water and take you to the bottom
458680	460120	of the ocean.
460120	464680	We did this step-by-step and the graduation exercise came at the end of that week.
464680	470800	And what that was, was going to be a parasail above the gulf where we were going to release
470800	477040	from the boat, enter the water, get out, get into a raft, signal for help and they would
477040	479080	come pick us up and we had to do that twice.
479080	485520	And if you did that twice successfully, you passed the water survival course.
485520	491720	That Friday came and I'm out on the Gulf of Mexico on a platform ship getting ready
491720	497360	to be hooked up to a cable to be taking parasailing for this final exam.
497360	501080	And my classmate right in front of me is Stephanie Wilson.
501080	505040	Stephanie Wilson is about five foot two and weighs about a hundred pounds.
505040	510480	Stephanie Wilson is about the size of one of my legs.
510480	514320	Stephanie starts marching in place, she gets a little tug from the boat, takes about a
514360	520040	step and off she goes like Peter Pan.
520040	527360	Then he hooked me up to the boat, to the line and I'm really, really nervous because not
527360	532360	only am I scared of the water, I am also afraid of heights.
532360	543360	Yeah, I know, let it out, an astronaut who's afraid of heights.
543400	550160	I start marching in place just like they told me and then I start walking and I'm getting
550160	556280	pulled and then I start walking faster and I start running and then I start thinking
556280	559200	this boat is not infinitely long.
559200	564760	I get to the edge of the platform and I'm still moving my legs, I haven't gotten airborne
565760	575000	And I start going toward the ocean and I plunge and belly flop about 20 feet and do a faceplant
575000	581760	into the water and then the boat starts dragging me through the water.
581760	586860	And as I'm trying to gasp for air and look, I see this chief petty officer, our instructor
586860	592520	in the back of that boat signaling to me telling me release from your chute, release from your
592520	593520	chute.
593520	596440	I release from the chute just like she told me.
596440	601940	Then they come and get me and my LPU, the thing that's supposed to save me, the life
601940	605840	preserving unit had popped on impact.
605840	613000	They had a Navy doctor check me out and he turns to the chief petty officer and says
613000	615280	he'll be okay.
615280	618480	And she looks at me and says that's good, you still got to do it twice, that didn't
618480	622480	count.
622480	629640	I get hooked up to the boat again, I start marching, I start running, I hit the edge
629640	635440	of the boat again and here comes round two with the water.
635440	646920	But this time I skim the water with my feet, my sail inflates and I rise above the water.
646920	650520	And then I get a signal from the chief petty officer, the green flags waving at me and
650560	652560	that means to release from the boat and I do that.
652560	661120	And then I go through my checklist, canopy, visor, mask, seat kit, LPU, three line jettison
661120	665440	and I steer myself down and I keep my eye on the horizon, horizon, horizon, let it
665440	670800	come, wait for it, I see the horizon coming up, my feet get a little bit wet, I release
670800	676540	from my chute, I do my survival exercise, they come get me and I have to do it one more
676540	678640	time and I can pass.
678640	689600	They hook me up again, I march, walk, run, drop, don't get wet, come up high and I pause
689600	696720	for a moment and I looked around, it was a beautiful day above the gulf that day, I could
696720	705440	see the coast of Florida, I could see the Atlantic Ocean and it hit me, what I was doing,
705440	711880	what an extraordinary experience this had been, a skinny kid from Long Island was going
711880	718040	through water survival training as an astronaut candidate, soon to be astronaut hopefully,
718040	722320	with the United States Navy and then I look down at the boat and frantically the chief
722320	726080	petty officer is waving a flag.
726080	732920	I release, do the whole routine again, land in the water and they come get me and I had
732920	738640	this great feeling of accomplishment, more than I ever had in my life, I had gone through
738640	744000	some tough tests as an undergraduate at Columbia, it almost killed me to get through my qualifying
744000	750920	exam for my PhD at MIT and complete my dissertation, but those things for some reason seemed doable,
750920	755760	this was facing one of the greatest fears I had and I had to do this in order to achieve
755760	762200	my dream of flying in space, I just felt like a superhero getting this done and then I realized
762200	766960	I had become a good swimmer, over those months of practicing and going through the swim test
766960	773280	and all these lessons and the Navy, I had become a really good swimmer, I had swim goggles,
773280	784600	I had a bathing suit, I could maybe do this for exercise for the rest of my life.
784600	791240	Since that day over the Gulf of Mexico, 20 years ago, I have never swam another lap.

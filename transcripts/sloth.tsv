0	12300	So, I'm sitting in my shrink's office this one time, and he says to me, how's it going?
12300	20100	And I say, well, to be honest, Doc, I had a really, really horrible experience the other
20100	21100	day.
21100	22820	And he says, tell me about it.
22820	27380	And I say, well, it all started when I was laying on my couch.
27380	31720	And he looks at me and he says, really?
31720	37520	Which if you know me, is an incredibly funny thing for him to say, because I have probably
37520	48140	spent more time lying on couches than any able-bodied man under the age of, say, 110
48140	50460	living today.
50500	59180	If lying on couches was a martial art, I would have a ninth-level black belt ninja master
59180	63100	status in it.
63100	67480	As a matter of fact, when I was originally asked by the moth to do this event, and they
67480	73600	explained about the seven deadly sins, I was amazed that sloth was even still available.
73600	79340	I assumed that sloth would be the first sin picked, because it is really the central thing
79340	81920	about our culture, isn't it?
81920	91300	We live in a whole society based on consumer entertainment and luxury effort reduction.
91300	97840	But within that culture, my own generation, which they used to call Gen X or slackers,
97840	103000	really distinguished itself, even among the general culture.
103000	110460	And within that elite group of underachievers, I distinguished myself as really a super-achiever
110460	113600	of underachievement.
113600	119200	If sloth is a sin, I think it's fair to say I'm really guilty of, like, Milosevic-level
119200	123920	crimes against humanity.
123920	129680	And if the Vatican conducted its affairs the way that governments do, there would be some
129680	137700	sort of secret Vatican sniper up in these windows ready to take me out right now.
137700	142800	I lived for years and years and years just bumming around this wonderful college town
142800	145200	called Madison, Wisconsin.
145200	147200	And did people know Madison?
147200	148200	Great.
148200	149200	That's fantastic.
149200	155000	And we had a whole culture there that was essentially built around couches.
155000	159880	Everything was centered around the living room, because what your life consisted of
159880	166920	was every second that you weren't slaving away at your shitty minimum wage job.
166920	169880	And that's, I'd like to dispel, a myth about slackers right now, which is that they don't
169880	171500	work hard.
171500	175480	Because in order to live a life of sloth, you really have to work like a slave to do
175480	176480	it.
176480	181160	Because opting out of the career rat race essentially means opting into the working
181160	186080	poor.
186080	190120	And so every second that you weren't at that job, you were sitting in your living room,
190120	197200	sitting with your friends, you're watching TV, you're smoking pot, you're listening
197200	202900	to rock and roll and watching DVDs, but mainly just engaging in conversation.
202900	210360	And you're trying to wring every last ounce of leisure, of luxury effort reduction out
210400	217120	of the remaining hours before your shift at the job you hate starts again.
217120	221600	We had a wonderful tradition in Madison, because every year when the students would move, the
221600	227320	frat guys would leave their furniture abandoned by the side of the road.
227320	234560	And so every year you would take the cigarette hole burned, beer stained, vomit smelling
234760	239920	couch that just stank like weed and cigarettes.
239920	242880	And you would pick it up and you'd march it out of the house and you'd set it down and
242880	246640	then you'd go get a brand new couch from the frat kids and you'd move it into the empty
246640	251040	space where you had the previous couch and you'd set it down and you'd have a wonderful
251040	255080	new couch to abuse for the following year.
255080	259180	Now one of the things I did during all these years of slacking in Madison was I was writing
259180	264480	jokes for The Onion and to my great surprise that eventually turned into a career.
265240	268440	And no one could have been more surprised about it than me, believe me.
268440	272200	And I ended up moving to New York and for the first time I had money, so I was incredibly
272200	277560	excited because I was not only going to be able to live this life of slack, but I was
277560	280520	going to be able to live it in style.
280520	287520	And I set up this wonderful apartment in Brooklyn, this nice living room and I filled it with
287960	288880	seating.
288880	295000	I bought a surround sound home theater and I got a DVD player for it.
295000	302000	I got a big TV and I got a fantastic number for a great connection with a top notch weed
302320	307320	delivery service.
307320	312680	And the best thing is I bought this fantastic, it was the couch of my dreams at this vintage
313000	313200	store.
313200	320560	I spent $500 on it, only couch I ever spent money on in my life.
320560	323920	And I was so looking forward to all the wonderful times I was going to have with all these great
323920	325840	new friends I was going to make in New York.
325840	331280	But what I didn't understand was that New York is not like Madison.
331280	338280	It's not a living room based town.
338560	344120	Because all of the Lower East Side downtown Bohemians that I was wanting to hang out with,
344120	347080	they don't have living rooms.
347080	352240	They have a box with a bed and a refrigerator and a toilet and a shower and a sink and that's
352240	353600	where they live.
353600	358800	And so in lieu of living rooms, they hang out in bars and restaurants.
358800	362040	And for that reason, it's also not a marijuana town, it's an alcohol town.
362040	366600	So I've had to learn to drink and I'm getting pretty good at it to be honest.
366600	373600	But none of those things really matter if, like me, you live in Brooklyn, but people
374160	376920	from Manhattan won't go to Brooklyn.
376920	381440	Because it's a 20 minute ride on the train and they're busy spending 40 to 80 minutes
381440	385420	waiting to get into the cool restaurant or bar.
385420	390740	So the upshot of all this is I spend about the next five years of my life in the ultimate
390740	397020	slack pad I've created, surrounded by empty seats, alone, playing video games, watching
397020	402100	DVDs, by myself.
402100	404580	Surrounded by empty seating.
404580	410580	And what's worse is that my DVD player even mocks me because whenever you hit stop a screen
410580	417580	saver comes on with their consumer entertainment home theater slogan that says everyone's invited.
418460	422300	Everyone's invited.
422300	429300	Every day, everyone's invited, but you're here by yourself, aren't you?
430740	437740	Over the years, the combined effects of A, gravity, B, time, and C, my ass on this couch,
438780	441900	literally destroy my dream couch.
441900	446940	The part of the couch where my ass is centered has collapsed completely.
446940	452900	There's like springs and metal falling out the bottom, stuffing is falling out the bottom.
452900	455740	There's just a hole where my ass is.
455740	461900	I have to fill it up with pillows and blankets and put a board over it just to continue to
461900	468900	lay on it.
470180	475260	At this point in this story, I'm sure that those of you in the audience with even a remote
475300	480860	sense of insight into the human condition are probably thinking to yourself, well, you
480860	484900	know, these stories are all kind of cute anecdotes and they're a little bit funny, but I have
484900	488500	another interpretation of everything this man on stage is saying and it sounds kind
488500	493220	of to me like he's describing the behavior of someone who is, not to put too fine a point
493220	496740	on it, clinically depressed.
496740	499140	And you would be right.
499140	503900	I happen to have been clinically depressed pretty much my entire adult life, which brings
503900	507620	us back to why I was sitting in my shrink's office in the first place telling him about
507620	509660	this horrible experience.
509660	511300	So he says, tell me about it.
511300	517380	I say, I'm laying on the couch and it was one of those days when you've run out of all
517380	519460	the distractions available in the living room.
519460	526460	Like I had watched all the DVDs, I had finished all the video games, I had masturbated to
526700	533700	all of the available pornography, I had smoked all the drugs, there was nothing left.
533940	540940	And I had a moment of zen stillness and clarity where I was face to face with myself.
541340	548340	And I looked in myself and I saw this horrific, nightmarish void of nothingness.
549880	556880	It was just this swirling vortex of empty zero.
556980	558340	There was nothing there.
558340	562320	I felt like I had no future, no past, no options, no hope.
562320	564720	Like there was nothing to believe in.
564720	569880	And at this point my shrink cuts me off and he says, Todd, Todd, wait, wait, hold on.
569880	574160	Right now I'm hearing a lot of negativity from you.
574160	581160	I mean, you're just describing a horrible descent into nihilism.
582240	586000	And I give him this look like, well, duh, you know, and I say, yeah, the reason you're
586000	590280	hearing that is because that's what I'm telling you.
590320	594040	And he says, well, Todd, but that's very serious.
594040	596240	Nihilism is a terrible place to end up.
596240	598880	Bad things happen to people that go there.
598880	602720	You can drown in that shit.
602720	605840	So I say, well, let me tell you, do I hear a cell phone?
605840	607440	Is that what that is?
607440	612280	So I tell him, maybe someone's just giving me a little hip hop background to this.
612280	617240	So I tell him, well, let me finish the story.
617240	620640	Have you ever been so depressed that you just can't get out of bed or you just can't
620640	626120	get out of your chair and you just end up relying on whatever's in arm's reach of you,
626120	627880	you know?
627880	633120	And so I'm sort of groping around the couch just looking for something, anything to distract
633120	636380	me from this horrible emptiness that I'm experiencing.
636380	640240	And I reach under the couch and I find this old paperback book that has been kicked under
640240	643440	there probably a couple months earlier and I pull it out and it's the ultimate perfect
643440	646840	book for lifting someone out of their own personal hell.
646840	657400	Happens to be, swear to God this is true, not making this up, Dante's Inferno.
657400	663000	So I'm like, I obviously cannot handle reading Dante's Inferno right now.
663000	666200	But lacking anything else to do, I decide I'm going to read the foreword.
666200	673280	So the foreword is written by some scholar of medieval Italian epic poetry or whatever.
673280	678360	And I start reading it and I say to my doc, as I was reading it, I learned a new word.
678360	680120	He says, what was it?
680120	683760	And I said, well, the word is acedia.
683760	685280	I'd never heard of this word before.
685280	688000	And he says, what does it mean?
688000	694720	I said, well, it was the medieval Catholic's word for the profound sense of emptiness that
694720	698040	comes from not believing in anything.
698040	705840	They saw it as a sin and specifically the sin of the failure, they defined it as the
705840	708480	failure to pursue God.
708480	717360	In other words, a lack of making the effort necessary to seek out the joy of God or more
717360	720280	generally of creation.
720280	726160	And it was considered so dangerous that they actually numbered it among the seven deadly
726160	728480	sins, acedia.
728480	732920	And by the way, I don't know if it's actually pronounced acedia because I'm a college dropout.
732920	735440	I don't know how to pronounce ancient Latin.
735440	738800	Granted, I knew I was going to be speaking in front of a couple hundred people.
738800	749200	I probably could have Googled it and figured out the pronunciation, but I was too lazy.
749200	755760	And at this point, I can tell that my shrink is a little uncomfortable with how the conversation
755760	758960	is going because he doesn't like talking about sin.
758960	765720	He doesn't like sin doctrine based modes of behavioral modification because he's a shrink.
765720	770680	And shrinks are always against thinking about things in terms of sin because sin is always
770680	771680	about guilt.
771680	773900	And a shrink's job is to get people to get over guilt.
773900	776520	So he's kind of trying to change the subject.
776520	784100	But what I say to him is the amazing thing about this is that in modern times, it's usually
784100	796020	translated or mistranslated, if you will, as sloth because it involves a lack of effort.
796020	801820	But the idea is, you know, when we hear sloth now, I mean, it just seems like laziness.
801820	802860	It's not that big of a sin.
802860	805020	It's not deadly.
805020	807500	But they were talking about something far more serious.
807500	811300	They were talking about a deep existential despair.
811300	813300	Thanks.
813300	824780	And I realized as I was talking to him that if I'm guilty of acedia, then so is our whole
824780	830240	consumer entertainment prozac taken depressed out of their mind nation.
830240	832140	And I figured there's two ways of looking at it.
832140	838900	Either we should be very grateful that ancient Catholic doctrine doesn't still dominate the
839900	844380	because if so, then me and the whole nation are all just guilty, unredeemable sinners
844380	846100	and can be written off.
846100	849300	But the second way of looking at it is perhaps a little more productive is that this was
849300	855180	a way of looking at my depression that didn't involve me being a helpless victim of a sickness
855180	861820	defined by a condition and that I might have some degree of personal responsibility for
861820	864740	my own state of mind.
864780	869860	So my shrink looks at me and he doesn't say anything for a very long time because he doesn't
869860	871220	like how the conversation's going.
871220	872460	But on the other hand, he's a smart guy.
872460	874860	So he's thinking very, very intently.
874860	880920	And finally, he looks up at me and he says, that's very interesting.
880920	884300	What are you going to do about it?
884300	891700	And I look back at him and I say, hmm, thank you.

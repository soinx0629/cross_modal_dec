0	2700	There are some scientists who say that the universe
2700	6600	that we inhabit is not the only universe there is.
6600	8640	There are alternate universes.
8640	10640	They say that these universes arise
10640	13720	from the subatomic realm of quantum physics.
13720	15240	Here's how they say it works.
15240	17680	Every time a quantum event happens,
17680	21560	it produces all of its possible results.
21560	23480	This is like saying if you flip a coin,
23480	27160	it comes up heads, but it also comes up tails.
27160	29840	Since those two results are mutually exclusive,
29840	32600	the flipping of the coin splits the universe
32600	36120	into two alternate universes, the heads universe
36120	37800	and the tails universe.
37800	40760	And since quantum events are happening all the time,
40760	42400	it means that alternate universes
42400	43840	are bubbling up continually.
43840	46280	They're always being created, splitting off from ours.
46280	48800	And these alternate universes are real.
48800	50880	They're not just figments of the imagination.
50880	53840	They're complete, whole, real things.
53840	57080	I know this is true because I experienced
57080	58460	an alternate universe.
60360	63400	I was driving in my Volkswagen van
63400	66080	up to a Tai Chi camp in upstate New York
66080	67320	a couple of summers ago.
69440	72560	I bought the Volkswagen van when I'd quit my job
72560	74100	a few years previously.
74100	76000	I bought the van because I quit the job
76000	78920	as a custom database application engineer.
79960	83000	This was not a job that I really had intended to become.
83000	84580	When I was a kid, that's not what I thought
84580	85820	I was going to be.
86720	88520	It's just sort of the job I happened into
88520	91060	and I always thought of it as the work I was doing
91060	94180	before I was going to find my real work.
94180	96360	But when I got close to about 40,
96360	99800	I suddenly thought, oh my God, this could be it.
99800	101160	This could be what I end up doing.
101160	102960	This could be on my tombstone.
102960	107640	Tom Weiser, custom database application engineer,
107640	109560	wrote well-optimized queries.
111280	113580	Many customers satisfied.
113580	115120	And I thought, no, that can't be it.
115120	116320	That can't be all there is.
116320	119160	And I quit the job without really knowing
119160	120440	what I was going to do next.
120440	124320	And I knew that what I should do was to take my skill set
124320	127480	and to make a lateral move to a career path
127480	129080	that was more appropriate.
129080	131340	But I really didn't want to do that.
131340	132520	I didn't want to be so logical.
132520	135680	I actually wanted something more magic.
135680	138360	I wanted to be like the guy in the fairy tale
138360	142120	that trades the cow for the magic beans.
142120	144880	And I know that that's a bad deal.
144880	149000	I know that the cow's a better investment.
149000	150800	The cow's going to pay off in the long term.
150800	154520	But if the magic beans work out,
154520	156280	you're in a whole new story.
158800	160600	So I quit the job and I bought
160600	163560	a Volkswagen pop-top camper van.
163560	166240	And I drove around country and what I thought is, okay,
166240	168140	I'm not going to make a lateral move.
168140	170160	I am going to drive around the country
170160	172840	and I'm going to open myself up to whatever may come.
172840	176240	And then what I'm going to do is going to arise organically.
176240	178080	I'm going to find my next path there
178080	179520	by the side of the road in Arizona.
179520	181920	I'm going to pick it up and bring it back to New York.
181920	186360	So I drove around the country, 25,000 miles, eight months.
186360	189640	And when I got back to New York, I had no clue.
191080	194440	I really didn't know and it left me very vulnerable
194440	196800	to the New York question.
196800	198640	The first question anybody asked, which is,
198640	200180	so, what do you do?
200180	203180	I didn't know.
203180	206740	I didn't have a good answer and it made me feel really embarrassed
206740	208420	because everybody knows what they do.
208420	211060	Everybody does and I thought I should too.
211060	214100	So when I was driving the Volkswagen van up to Tai Chi Camp
214100	216660	the other summer, I felt very relieved
216660	220060	because in camp, I know what I do.
220060	221260	I do the camp thing.
221260	222260	I do what's at camp.
222260	223500	And I don't know if you know this,
223500	225900	but there are a lot of camps for adults that are out there.
225900	228580	I found them when I was driving around the country.
228620	231060	There are Tai Chi camps and yoga camps
231060	232740	and bird watching camps.
232740	234940	There's even a camp where you can dress up in armor
234940	236020	and joust.
238020	240340	All the things that give us joy
240340	242940	and that we tend to demean with the name hobby,
242940	246540	those are the things that are celebrated in camp.
246540	249060	And when people go to camp, they are so lit up.
249060	251020	They are finally getting to do that thing,
251020	251860	the thing they love.
251860	254180	It's like, yes, I finally get to joust.
254180	255940	I don't have time for that anymore.
255940	256780	Really.
259220	262460	So I was going up to camp and feeling pretty good about it.
262460	265460	And I decided on the way, I would stop into Ithaca.
265460	267420	I'd heard that it was kind of a neat town.
267420	270060	So I pulled off the highway into Ithaca
270060	273460	and it's on the southern shore of Lake Cayuga.
273460	274980	There's flatland and these hills
274980	278180	and it has a very particular microclimate there
278180	279980	which allows hippies to survive.
281700	284140	All the stores have names like it takes a village
284140	285540	or hemp unlimited.
286540	289860	And the children are all completely multi-ethnic
289860	291900	and only wear cloth, organic diapers.
291900	293980	It was really something.
293980	296180	I drove around like sort of like Disney hippie land,
296180	297020	just watching it.
297020	299420	And then I drove up the hill up toward Cornell
299420	301820	which has these stately buildings on the hilltop.
301820	304820	And as I drove onto the campus,
304820	306780	I had this stabbing sensation
306780	308860	and I suddenly was pierced with a vision
308860	312580	of an alternate universe, my alternate life.
312580	315260	I thought, oh my God, I was supposed to go to Cornell.
316460	318860	If I had gone to Cornell,
318860	321180	I would have studied animal behavior.
321180	324500	And right now I'd be a professor of evolutionary biology.
326380	328060	I'm a professor of evolutionary biology
328060	330180	and I've got a wife.
330180	331940	She's got dark hair.
331940	333660	She's really smart.
333660	337580	And I'm a professor with a wife and we've got two kids.
337580	338820	They like to sing.
339940	342900	It was this completely realized vision
342900	344900	of this alternate life and it looked so good.
344940	347740	Alternate Ithaca, Tom, he'd made these great choices.
347740	349140	It was really working out.
350700	354300	And I drove around in a kind of a wash of nostalgia
354300	356500	for this life that I hadn't had.
356500	359820	It's like, wow, there's the human ecology center.
359820	361540	I did all my grad work there.
362660	364940	And there was this funky cottage that I used to live in
364940	367620	when I had six roommates and we had a chore wheel
367620	369340	and ate brown rice.
370980	373700	And there was these gorges that we used to do drum circles
373980	375300	and songs to the goddess.
375300	379260	And there was this woman that looked just like my wife
379260	381460	would have looked when I would have met her.
382780	383980	I was overwhelmed by it.
383980	386140	I couldn't stand to stay there any longer.
386140	387740	I drove off the campus.
387740	390900	I fled Ithaca and flew to Tai Chi Camp.
391940	394100	But alternate Ithaca, Tom, came with me.
395500	398860	Now at camps, I tend to really have a good time.
398860	402020	I laugh a lot, I joke a lot, especially in Tai Chi Camp
402020	405020	but the residents are kind of serious and slow moving.
406580	408740	I can't help but kind of tease them.
408740	411540	And in this particular camp,
411540	414060	the teacher said that we were going to be meditating
414060	416260	every morning from seven to eight.
416260	419940	And she was looking for a volunteer, someone, a musician
419940	423380	that would wander the hallways, playing an instrument
423380	425920	or singing to wake up the residents.
426900	428980	I'm not a morning person.
428980	431300	And so I thought, oh, so I have a choice here.
431300	434500	Either it's gonna be 6.30, I'll be lying in my bed,
434500	438980	really grumpy, while some asshole sings outside my door.
438980	441820	Or I could be the singing asshole.
444340	445180	For the rest of that week,
445180	447180	I was the singing asshole of the camp.
447180	450580	Every morning I would roam the hall singing lustily,
450580	452980	waking up all my fellow Tai Chi players.
452980	457340	And the people there saw me laughing and singing
457340	459420	and they said, Tom, it's really great to have you here.
459420	460260	You're so happy.
460260	461300	You're such a happy guy.
461300	463420	And I thought, yeah, you think I'm happy,
463420	465980	but you haven't seen alternate Ithaca Tom.
465980	466860	I've seen him.
466860	468340	He's happy.
468340	470260	And the fact that he was so much happier than me
470260	471940	was making me miserable.
473140	475540	And I kept looking at everybody else's life
475540	477260	and comparing myself to them.
477260	479140	And I remember having lunch with a woman
479140	481660	who were in her 60s and she was a calligrapher.
481660	483580	And she was about to have her first grandchild.
483580	484540	She was really excited.
484540	489300	And I thought, maybe calligraphy, that could be it.
489300	490860	And then there was this other guy
490860	492940	and he had studied Tai Chi when he was in his 20s
492940	494900	and now he was a sales rep at Dell.
494900	498180	And I thought, damn it, if I had studied Tai Chi in my 20s,
498180	501620	maybe I could be a sales rep at Dell now.
501620	503220	I've never wanted to be a sales rep,
503220	505500	but I was just getting carried away.
505500	507620	That feeling that I was in the wrong life,
507620	509900	I was in the wrong place, I couldn't shake it.
509900	513060	I really tried to absorb the lesson of Tai Chi,
513060	515700	which is to be present, just relax,
515700	518660	accept what's coming to you and be present here.
518660	520300	But I thought, yeah, yeah, that would be easy.
520300	522660	It's so much easier to accept where you are
522660	524620	if only you're in the right place.
527820	530220	Eventually camp was over and I left.
530220	531460	I drove back to New York.
531460	534140	And as I was driving over the George Washington Bridge,
534140	536140	I could still hear alternate Ithaca Tom.
536140	538980	He was hanging around me, haunting me like a ghost.
538980	542500	And I thought, oh God, I need professional help.
542500	544900	So I made an appointment with the family psychic.
545500	549100	This is the guy that's done readings
549100	550940	for all of my siblings and my cousins.
550940	553500	And I went to see him and he's an astrologer.
553500	554820	So he did out my chart.
554820	557620	And this time he was very interested
557620	559660	in this polarity that he saw.
559660	562340	He said, you have Saturn in the mid heaven.
562340	564340	And this marks you as a person
564340	566220	who could be very organizational.
566220	569140	The organizational man, the hierarchical one,
569140	571740	the corporate guy, the dad, the provider,
571740	574700	not particularly sexy, but a straight up guy.
574740	577540	On the other hand, there's Pisces and the sun.
577540	579460	And they're squared with each other.
579460	580300	You can't resolve them.
580300	582340	Piscean, the dreamer, the mystic,
582340	584940	the guy that's the artist never quite pinned down,
584940	586340	never quite in a relationship.
586340	588300	And you have to balance these two.
588300	589940	You have to choose one or the other.
589940	592660	And normally I love to hear this kind of thing.
592660	594620	This is the great thing about going to a psychic
594620	597380	is that for an hour they just talk about me.
597380	599660	It's so interesting.
599660	603060	But this time I was so caught up with alternate Ithaca time,
603060	604900	I couldn't really appreciate it all.
604900	607060	So I just blurted out what had happened to me.
607060	608820	And I asked him, what does this mean?
608820	612260	And the psychic said, wow, this represents
612260	615180	a fundamental choice that you've made in your life.
615180	617780	You could have been the hierarchical guy,
617780	620180	but you chose to be the Piscean.
620180	623580	If you had decided to be an academic,
623580	625620	you would have been very successful.
625620	627460	There's no doubt that the youth
628460	630700	There's no doubt that the university structure
630700	632180	would have raised you up.
632180	634020	You probably would be married, have kids.
634020	635940	And I thought, oh shit, alternate Ithaca time
635940	637740	made the right choices.
637740	641020	But the psychic said, if you had become an academic,
641020	642940	your wife would have had an affair with your brother
642940	644020	or your best friend.
645860	647860	Alternate Ithaca time is crushed.
648820	650900	He's just found out that his wife is having an affair
650900	651940	with his research partner.
651940	654340	This is the guy he's been working with for 15 years.
654340	655420	It's a long-term affair.
655420	656780	They're moving in together.
656780	658780	She's taking the kids.
658780	660140	He's completely crushed.
660140	661620	Poor alternate Ithaca time.
661620	662980	He starts drinking.
662980	665020	He can't keep his lecture notes together.
665020	666500	He can't keep his research together.
666500	668700	He's coming up for tenure and it's all falling apart.
668700	670980	And in the midst of his turmoil,
670980	674740	he's suddenly pierced by this vision of himself
674740	676500	driving a Volkswagen van.
678180	680220	He's off to camp.
680220	682140	It's a Tai Chi camp.
682140	683740	He's not married.
683740	684900	He doesn't have kids.
684900	687500	He doesn't even have a job.
687500	689260	He's completely free.
689260	690780	It looks so good.
690780	693380	This image, it pierces him to his heart.
693380	695380	Begins to hang around him and haunt him
695380	697100	like a hungry ghost.
698300	699140	Thank you.
699140	699980	Thank you.
699980	700820	Thank you.
700820	701660	Thank you.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
A couple of weeks after I got my phone call from NASA that I was selected to be an astronaut,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,600
my information packet came in the mail.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,620
And the cover letter had a paragraph at the beginning that said, congratulations.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:24,360
And then there was the second paragraph, and it said, practice your swimming.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,680
You will be required to pass a swim test in order to go to water survival training

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,960
with the United States Navy in Pensacola.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,800
And I could not believe this, because after years of applications and interviews and medical

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:49,000
examinations from head to toe and an extensive background check, never once did anyone ever

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:03,160
think to ask, do you know how to swim?

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,960
And if they did, my answer would have been, not really.

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,000
Although I grew up on Long Island and was surrounded by water my entire life, I didn't

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,120
like swimming, and I completely hated the water.

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,000
I was a skinny little kid who was always freezing when I got wet, and I didn't like having my

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,880
head under the water.

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,200
I couldn't breathe.

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,480
I didn't like having chlorine in my eyes.

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,200
When I would go to a pool party, I would go on my tippy toes just so my head was exposed

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,920
and pretend like I was having a good time.

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,680
And now the one thing that I hated and avoided my entire life had now become the one thing

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,560
that I had to do well, and the one thing that was going to stand between me and my dream

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,880
of flying in space.

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,080
I wasn't going to let that stop me.

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,880
I had the summer to get ready.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,360
I took my kids to the pool every day, and I swam, and I practiced, and I practiced,

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,960
and I practiced.

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,240
And at the end of that summer, I reported for duty at the Johnson Space Center, a much

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,480
better swimmer, but still very, very nervous about what I was going to have to do there.

28
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,440
And I reported there with 43 other new astronauts, but we weren't really astronauts yet.

29
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:35,600
We were astronaut candidates, or as our senior astronauts called us, ass cans.

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,880
We were all 44 new ass cans.

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,360
And in our initial briefing, they told us how we could grow up to be astronauts.

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,640
And they gave us a list of things that we were going to be doing over the next two years,

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,120
all the different examinations and qualifications that we would have to get in order to do that.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,280
And the very first test we were going to have was the swim test.

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,000
And I was like, really?

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,440
Can't we have like a math quiz or a physics test?

37
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,960
And then the briefer went on and said, OK, all the strong swimmers in this class, raise

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
your hand.

39
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,920
And a couple of the military people raised their hand.

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,160
We had a Navy diver raise her hand.

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:32,040
And then he asked, OK, all the weak swimmers, raise your hands and be honest.

42
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,680
And I sheepishly raised my hand along with a couple of other egghead PhDs.

43
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,480
And he said, great.

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,680
You strong swimmers and you weak swimmers, this weekend, you're going to work together.

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,240
And you strong swimmers are going to get these weak swimmers ready to pass the test.

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,720
That's exactly what we did.

47
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,760
And we showed up that next week, all 44 of us, to take this test in full gear, flight

48
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,640
suit, boots, and helmet.

49
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,800
And the feeling that day was, everyone was going to pass, and we were not going to leave

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,840
that pool until everyone passed.

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,160
And we got in the water, and we did our long distance swim, demonstrating all the survival

52
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,200
strokes that we needed to show.

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,400
We did a lap underwater.

54
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,560
We demonstrated that we could save each other, do a rescue swim.

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,800
We drowned proof, and we got on our back with only our mouth exposed, bringing in sips of

56
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,520
air to fill our lungs, so we get buoyancy on the water.

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,520
And then after you were good and tired from all that, it was time to tread, tread water.

58
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,040
And in the last few minutes of that tread, they blew a whistle, and you had to bring

59
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,000
your hands out of the water.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,040
And if your hands went underneath the water, you failed, and you had to do the whole test

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,800
over again.

62
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,600
And as I'm treading for dear life with my hands out of the water those last few minutes,

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,200
I'm looking around at my new classmates, I look for Mike Fink, and don't see him anymore.

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,360
But I see his hands.

65
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,880
They didn't say anything about your head being out of the water.

66
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,200
They only said your hands had to be out of the water.

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,120
And by golly, Mike was not going to let his hands go under that water.

68
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,560
And I realized just how determined this group of people was.

69
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,240
These people that I had now become classmates with, future astronauts with.

70
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Every one of us passed.

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Everyone passed that test.

72
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,600
And a few weeks later, we flew down to Naval Air Station Pensacola, the home of naval aviation.

73
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,200
And for a kid who dreamt about being an astronaut and watched the right stuff a thousand times

74
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,000
and read that book about a hundred times, I was in heaven.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,240
There were F-18s with blue angels in them screaming overhead.

76
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,480
There were young Navy and Marine recruits exercising and running all over the place.

77
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,260
And then there was us.

78
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:16,040
And we were there to be trained to eject out of a high-performance aircraft, be able to

79
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,360
work our parachute and our survival gear and survive in the water long enough for someone

80
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,080
to come and get us.

81
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,500
Now this is something that I would never dream of doing in a million years.

82
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,880
And I found out how the Navy was going to get us ready to do this.

83
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,520
You don't jump out of the plane the first day.

84
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,720
What you do is you take it step by step and they build you up inch by inch, baby steps,

85
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,600
until you're ready to do the big exercise at the end of the week.

86
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,320
So what we started to do was get by the end of the pool, just on the edge of the pool,

87
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,760
and jump in.

88
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,440
And then once you got that down, you went on a platform about a foot off the water and

89
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,680
you jumped from there and you got progressively higher.

90
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,600
And then they taught us how to go through our checklist.

91
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,680
Once we ejected from the aircraft, make sure your canopy was good.

92
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,520
You needed a good canopy above your head and if you didn't have one, they told you what

93
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
to do to fix it.

94
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,320
And then you went through all your other checks.

95
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,040
Make sure your mask is off, your visor is up.

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,800
All your seat kit with all your survival gear.

97
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,640
And then make sure, most important, one of the most important things for me anyway, was

98
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,180
that your LPU, your life preserver unit, was inflated because that's what's going to keep

99
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,400
you floating when you hit the water.

100
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,720
And then pull three lines, a three-line jettison which allows you to steer the parachute.

101
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,280
And after you got into the water, they taught us how to get away from the parachute and

102
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,680
how to release from it because that could fill with water and take you to the bottom

103
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,120
of the ocean.

104
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,680
We did this step-by-step and the graduation exercise came at the end of that week.

105
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,800
And what that was, was going to be a parasail above the gulf where we were going to release

106
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,040
from the boat, enter the water, get out, get into a raft, signal for help and they would

107
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,080
come pick us up and we had to do that twice.

108
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,520
And if you did that twice successfully, you passed the water survival course.

109
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,720
That Friday came and I'm out on the Gulf of Mexico on a platform ship getting ready

110
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,360
to be hooked up to a cable to be taking parasailing for this final exam.

111
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,080
And my classmate right in front of me is Stephanie Wilson.

112
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,040
Stephanie Wilson is about five foot two and weighs about a hundred pounds.

113
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,480
Stephanie Wilson is about the size of one of my legs.

114
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,320
Stephanie starts marching in place, she gets a little tug from the boat, takes about a

115
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,040
step and off she goes like Peter Pan.

116
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:47,360
Then he hooked me up to the boat, to the line and I'm really, really nervous because not

117
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,360
only am I scared of the water, I am also afraid of heights.

118
00:08:52,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Yeah, I know, let it out, an astronaut who's afraid of heights.

119
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,160
I start marching in place just like they told me and then I start walking and I'm getting

120
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,280
pulled and then I start walking faster and I start running and then I start thinking

121
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,200
this boat is not infinitely long.

122
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,760
I get to the edge of the platform and I'm still moving my legs, I haven't gotten airborne

123
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:35,000
And I start going toward the ocean and I plunge and belly flop about 20 feet and do a faceplant

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,760
into the water and then the boat starts dragging me through the water.

125
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,860
And as I'm trying to gasp for air and look, I see this chief petty officer, our instructor

126
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,520
in the back of that boat signaling to me telling me release from your chute, release from your

127
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
chute.

128
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,440
I release from the chute just like she told me.

129
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,940
Then they come and get me and my LPU, the thing that's supposed to save me, the life

130
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,840
preserving unit had popped on impact.

131
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:13,000
They had a Navy doctor check me out and he turns to the chief petty officer and says

132
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,280
he'll be okay.

133
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,480
And she looks at me and says that's good, you still got to do it twice, that didn't

134
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
count.

135
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,640
I get hooked up to the boat again, I start marching, I start running, I hit the edge

136
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,440
of the boat again and here comes round two with the water.

137
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:46,920
But this time I skim the water with my feet, my sail inflates and I rise above the water.

138
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,520
And then I get a signal from the chief petty officer, the green flags waving at me and

139
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
that means to release from the boat and I do that.

140
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:01,120
And then I go through my checklist, canopy, visor, mask, seat kit, LPU, three line jettison

141
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,440
and I steer myself down and I keep my eye on the horizon, horizon, horizon, let it

142
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,800
come, wait for it, I see the horizon coming up, my feet get a little bit wet, I release

143
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,540
from my chute, I do my survival exercise, they come get me and I have to do it one more

144
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,640
time and I can pass.

145
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:29,600
They hook me up again, I march, walk, run, drop, don't get wet, come up high and I pause

146
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,720
for a moment and I looked around, it was a beautiful day above the gulf that day, I could

147
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:45,440
see the coast of Florida, I could see the Atlantic Ocean and it hit me, what I was doing,

148
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,880
what an extraordinary experience this had been, a skinny kid from Long Island was going

149
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,040
through water survival training as an astronaut candidate, soon to be astronaut hopefully,

150
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,320
with the United States Navy and then I look down at the boat and frantically the chief

151
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,080
petty officer is waving a flag.

152
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:12,920
I release, do the whole routine again, land in the water and they come get me and I had

153
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,640
this great feeling of accomplishment, more than I ever had in my life, I had gone through

154
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,000
some tough tests as an undergraduate at Columbia, it almost killed me to get through my qualifying

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,920
exam for my PhD at MIT and complete my dissertation, but those things for some reason seemed doable,

156
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,760
this was facing one of the greatest fears I had and I had to do this in order to achieve

157
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,200
my dream of flying in space, I just felt like a superhero getting this done and then I realized

158
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,960
I had become a good swimmer, over those months of practicing and going through the swim test

159
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:53,280
and all these lessons and the Navy, I had become a really good swimmer, I had swim goggles,
